# Zotero: Better Bib(La)TeX [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ReichenHack/zotero-better-bibtex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ReichenHack/zotero-better-bibtex)

This extension aims to make Zotero effective for us LaTeX holdouts. It adds the following features:

* **Converts from/to HTML/LaTeX**: Currently supports i/\emph/\textit, b/\textbf, sup/\_{...} and sub/^{...}; more can
  be added on request. Finally add italics and super/supscript to your titles! The plugin contains a comprehensive list
  of LaTeX constructs, so stuff like \"{o} or \"o will be converted to their unicode equivalents on import.
* Integration with **[Report Customizer](https://github.com/ReichenHack/zotero-better-bibtex/wiki/Citation-Keys)**
* Set your own, fixed **[Citation Keys](https://github.com/ReichenHack/zotero-better-bibtex/wiki/Citation-Keys)**, generate citation keys from JabRef patterns, drag and drop LaTeX citations, add other custom BibLaTeX fields
* **[Customized Exports](https://github.com/ReichenHack/zotero-better-bibtex/wiki/Customized-Exports)**
* **Jabref groups import/export**: During import, if JabRef explicit (not dynamic) groups are present, collections will
  be created to mirror these. During export, collections will be added to the export as explicit jabref groups.
* **Fixes date field exports**: export dates like 'forthcoming' as 'forthcoming' instead of empty.
* **[Pull Export](https://github.com/ReichenHack/zotero-better-bibtex/wiki/Pull-Export)** from the embedded webserver
