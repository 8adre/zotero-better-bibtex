# Zotero: Better Bib(La)TeX (BBT) [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/ZotPlus/zotero-better-bibtex.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/ZotPlus/zotero-better-bibtex) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ZotPlus/zotero-better-bibtex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ZotPlus/zotero-better-bibtex)

This extension aims to make Zotero effective for us LaTeX holdouts. At its core, it behaves like any Zotero
import/export module; anywhere you can export or import bibliography items in Zotero, you'll find Better Bib(La)TeX
listed as one of the choices. If nothing else, you could keep your existing workflow as-is, and just enjoy the emproved
LaTeX &lt;-&gt; unicode translation on im-and export. Over and above this improvement, it addresses a whole host of
must-haves for TeXheads; if you just want to download the XPI, go to the
[releases](https://github.com/ZotPlus/zotero-better-bibtex/releases) page; all details are available at the
[Better BibTeX](https://zotplus.github.io/better-bibtex/) site.
