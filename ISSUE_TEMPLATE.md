This issue is about:

* [ ] BibTeX export
* [ ] BibLaTeX export
* [ ] Other

(feel free to check multiple)

When the issue is about export of any kind, please right-click the references where you experience the export problem, select "Send Better BibTeX Error", and post the resulting report ID (shown in red after you submit) here.

If you wish to report a combination of feature requests, bug reports and general usage questions, please file a separate report for each of these. It is easier for me to manage them separately.
