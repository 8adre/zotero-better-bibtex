      <title>Automatic export</title>

      <description>When exporting using BBT you will be offered a new export option: Keep updated. Checking this option registers the export for automation; any changes to the collection or library you exported after you&amp;rsquo;ve completed the current export will trigger an automatic re-export to update the bib file. You can review/remove exports from the BBT preferences. While I&amp;rsquo;ve gone to some lengths to make sure performance is OK, don&amp;rsquo;t go overboard with the number of auto-exports you have going.</description>

      <description>PSA: as of Zotero 5.0.71, access to the CAYW URL will no longer work from the browser for security reasons; curl and other programmatic access such as from editors access will work.
Good news for TeXnicians and those down with Mark (aka Markdown, RST, whatnot): this is the time to go pester the author of your favorite editor for Zotero integration!

      <description>Are there any plans to support Firefox 57+? BBT lives where Zotero lives, and Zotero only has standalone these days. BBT is installed inside Zotero instead of in the browser. Please see the installation instructions to get started with BBT.
BBT is changing the capitalization of my titles &amp;ndash; why? There isn&amp;rsquo;t a straightforward one-to-one mapping for all Zotero to Bib(La)TeX fields. For most I can make reasonable choices, but there are some things where Better BibTeX takes a little more liberties with your references in order to get sensible output.</description>

      <description>You can convert a Pandoc-compatible markdown source to a LibreOffice or Word document with live citation fields connecting to Zotero. Download the Pandoc filter
Add some metadata to your markdown file in a YAML header:
--- # all the regular stuff you have here zotero: bibliography: http://127.0.0.1:23119/better-bibtex/library?/1/library.json scannable-cite: false # only relevant when your compiling to scannable-cite .odt ... or you can specify them on the pandoc command line:
pandoc -s --lua-filter=zotero.</description>

      <guid>/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/pull/</guid>
      <description>You can fetch your bibliography on the url http://127.0.0.1:23119/better-bibtex/collection?[collectionID].[format] 1, where collectionID is:
 the ID you get by right-clicking your collection and selecting &amp;ldquo;Show collection key&amp;rdquo; the path &amp;ldquo;/[library id]/full/path/to/collection&amp;rdquo; (the library id is the first number from the key you get in the option above; it&amp;rsquo;s always &amp;lsquo;0&amp;rsquo; for your personal library)  or any multiple of those, separated by a &amp;lsquo;+&amp;rsquo; sign.
The format is either &amp;lsquo;bibtex&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;biblatex&amp;rsquo;, and determines the translator used for export.</description>

      <description>The Better BibTeX exporters are a lot slower than the standard Zotero Bib(La)TeX exporters. If you have a small library, you will not likely notice this, but if you have several thousand references, and you are in the habit of exporting substantial parts of your library, this gets annoying really fast.
To deal with this problem, Better BibTeX implements an extensive caching system. With a filled cache, Better BibTeX is substantially faster than the default Zotero exporters.</description>

      <description>You wanted customized&amp;hellip; You got customized. If you go into the Advanced tab of the Better BibTeX preferences you will find a text box (empty by default) where you can edit a javascript snippet which will be executed for each reference generated in the Bib(La)TeX exporter. In this code, you have access to the reference just before it will be written out and cached. There is an API to do this, and it&amp;rsquo;s fairly stable, but usually you can just open a new issue and ask me to write it, and I&amp;rsquo;ll add it here (it&amp;rsquo;s how the examples got here).</description>

      <description>You are a hardcore LaTeX user If you&amp;rsquo;d really just rather hand-code your LaTeX constructs, BBT makes that possible:
 You can add literal LaTeX anywhere in your reference by surrounding it with &amp;lt;script&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; (&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; will also work for historical reasons) markers. BBT will convert to/from unicode and (un)escape where required but will pass whatever is enclosed in the pre tags unchanged. An entry tagged with #LaTeX (case-sensitive!) will have all fields exported as if they&amp;rsquo;re wrapped in &amp;lt;script&amp;gt;.</description>

      <description>You can populate a reference collection, or tag items in your library, from an existing paper by scanning the aux file generated by bibtex. AUX Scanning can be triggered from the Tools menu (for tagging the cited items) or by right-clicking a collection (for adding them to a collection). The scanner will read your AUX files and will put references you cited in the associated LaTeX document into the current collection.</description>

      <description>Please DO NOT DO THIS without an open issue on the github tracker. I&amp;rsquo;ve been running tests this way for years, but I&amp;rsquo;d still prefer to guide you through this to prevent any risks to your citation library. The test suite has only been tested on MacOS and Linux. I doubt it&amp;rsquo;ll run on Windows, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know what will go wrong when you test. If you&amp;rsquo;re on Windows, DO NOT run this on the same account that holds your actual Zotero library.</description>

      <description>The Better BibTeX Configuration can be found under the regular Zotero preferences pane, tab &amp;lsquo;Better BibTeX&amp;rsquo;.
The configuration of Better BibTeX is a little baroque compared to the standard Zotero Bib(La)TeX exporters (which only have hidden preferences). The defaults should just work, but here&amp;rsquo;s an attempt to describe what they do.
Making any change here will drop your entire export cache. This is usually not a problem unless you have a really large library, but you can read about what is involved here.</description>

curl http://localhost:23119/better-bibtex/json-rpc -X POST -H &amp;quot;Content-Type: application/json&amp;quot; -H &amp;quot;Accept: application/json&amp;quot; --data-binary &#39;{&amp;quot;jsonrpc&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2.0&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;method&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;collection.scanAUX&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;params&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;/My Library/thesis/article1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;/Users/phantom/Downloads/output.aux&amp;quot;] }&#39; The available methods are:
autoexport.add(collection, translator, path, displayOptions, replace) Add an auto-export for the given collection. The target collection will be created if it does not exist
 collection: The forward-slash separated path to the collection.</description>

      <description>Better BibTeX bundles 5 translators you might care about:
Export These translators are supported by the auto-export functionality built into Better BibTeX:
 Better BibLaTeX exports references in BibLaTeX format (but better, natch) Better BibTeX exports references in BibTeX format Better CSL JSON exports references in pandoc-compatible CSL-JSON format, with added citation keys and parsing of metadata Better CSL YAML exports the same as the Better CSL JSON exporter, but in YAML format Collected Notes exports just notes &amp;ndash; standalone notes and notes attached to references, not the extra field &amp;ndash; to HTML.</description>

      <description>While the development needs of BBT are to a large extent covered by the generosity towards open-source developers of services such as github and travis, my development system does require the occasional upgrade; also, I enjoy getting the occasional frivolous tech-toy that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t otherwise grant myself. While you should feel in no way obligated to pay for BBT, anything you can spare is very much appreciated. If you&amp;rsquo;d rather contribute a little bit each month (and a little means a lot) so I can save up for a replacement a year or so down the line, head on over to Patreon, but mind that Patreon takes a fairly large cut of what you give.</description>
