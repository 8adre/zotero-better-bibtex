      <description>PSA: as of Zotero 5.0.71, access to this URL will no longer work from the browser for security reasons; curl and other programmatic access will work. In 5.0.71 and 5.0.72 you were required to send a User-Agent header (anything will work, as long as it&amp;rsquo;s there, curl sends a user-agent header by default); as of 5.0.73, the user agent requirement was dropped.
Good news for TeXnicians and those down with Mark (aka Markdown, RST, whatnot): this is the time to go pester the author of your favorite editor for Zotero integration!</description>
