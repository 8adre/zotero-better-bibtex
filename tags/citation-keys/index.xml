      <description>Generating citekeys for your references The BibTeX citations keys generated by the standard Zotero exporters are always generated at time of export, using an algorithm that usually generates unique keys. For serious LaTeX users, &amp;ldquo;usually&amp;rdquo; presents the following problems:
 If a non-unique key is generated, which one gets postfixed with a distinguishing character is essentially non-deterministic. The keys are always auto-generated, so if you correct a typo in the author name or title, the key will change You can&amp;rsquo;t see the citation keys until you export them  For a LaTeX author, the citation keys have their own meaning, fully separate from the other reference data, even if people usually pick a naming scheme related to them.</description>

      <description>Citation key format default: [auth:lower][shorttitle3_3][year]
Set the pattern used to generate citation keys. The format of the keys is documented here.
Force citation key to plain text default: yes
If you have deviated from the default citation key format pattern by specifying your own, you may wind up with non-ASCII characters in your citation keys. You can prevent that using the fold function at the appropriate place in your pattern, but checking this checkbox will just apply fold to all your keys.</description>

      <description>You can populate a reference collection, or tag items in your library, from an existing paper by scanning the aux file generated by bibtex. AUX Scanning can be triggered from the Tools menu (for tagging the cited items) or by right-clicking a collection (for adding them to a collection). The scanner will read your AUX files and will put references you cited in the associated LaTeX document into the current collection.</description>

      <description>Good news for TeXnicians and those down with Mark (aka Markdown, RST, whatnot): this is the time to go pester the author of your favorite editor for Zotero integration!
Editor integration vim Graciously supplied by David Lukes:
paste it in your .vimrc (and modify to your liking):
function! ZoteroCite() &amp;quot; pick a format based on the filetype (customize at will) let format = &amp;amp;filetype =~ &#39;.*tex&#39; ? &#39;citep&#39; : &#39;pandoc&#39; let api_call = &#39;http://127.</description>
