Abstract

We present a simple and inexpensive ‘one-step’ protocol for the hydrolysis of DNA to

deoxyribonucleosides. Unlike the older DNA hydrolysis protocol which is cumbersome and labor

intensive, thes new protocol is ideal for high-throughput assays and is suitable automation. Using

this protocol we were able to hydrolyze several hundred samples within an 8-hour period. The new

protocol is fully compatible with LC-MS/MS and gives similar recoveries for all five major

deoxyribonucleosides when compared to the older protocol.


The requirement to hydrolyze DNA to deoxyribonucleosides is a common component of

several assays. To measure the turnover of DNA [1,2] or cells [3–5] in various tissues, DNA

can be labeled with isotope-labeled precursor. In such studies, the DNA is extracted,

hydrolyzed, and analyzed to determine label incorporation by mass spectrometry. Likewise,

in vivo experiments in humans, such as examination of the effect of gene polymorphisms [6]

and nutritional status [6,7] on DNA metabolism, have used labeled one-carbon donors to label

monocyte DNA. Nucleoside hydrolysates of DNA also have been used in determining the base

composition of DNA, including investigation of epigenetic modification such as deoxycytosine

methylation [8,9], oxidative damage [10,11], or unique DNA composition [12].


One of the most commonly used protocols for digesting DNA is the tri-enzyme protocol

devised by Crain [13]. However, a major weakness of the Crain protocol is that the first enzyme

in the reaction, nuclease P1 (E.C. 3.1.30.1), only can digest single stranded DNA and has a pH

optimum (pH ~5) significantly lower and a reaction temperature significantly higher (~50°C)

than the other two enzymes (pH >8 and ~37°C) in the reaction. This leads to an overly complex

protocol [Fig 1], whereby the DNA must be boiled to denature (and rapidly cooled to prevent

reversion), the pH of the sample is adjusted twice, and the sample undergoes three separate

enzyme incubations. These complexities limit the number of samples that can be prepared. For

logistical reasons (repetitive manipulations of tubes), we were typically [6] restricted to

preparing ~60 samples per day when we used the Crain protocol. Furthermore, the Crain

protocol uses high buffer concentrations (e.g., 50–100 mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate, pH

7.9) which can interfere with downstream reactions and assays. Therefore, we devised a simple

In the agricultural research, situations are presented where it is difficult to use the classical linear models of analysis of variance, because 

the assumptions of independence, equality of variances and linearity are not fulfilled by making measures repeated in time. This paper

had as object to review the statistical procedures used to analyze the designs of measures repeated in time, and determine which analytical

strategies are more appropriate for each purpose. In this study, three types of traditionally used analyses are described: univariate variance

(ANOVA), multivariate variance (MANOVA), and the recent one, the approach of mixed models. At present, it has been agreed that the latter 

is the most adequate and versatile, because it provides the possibility of examining data with structures of dependence, unbalance, and lack

of normality. Besides, it provides a solution to the limitation of the multivariate analysis of variance in respect to the number of individuals 

and variables. Also, the model of random effects is described, another member of the wide spectrum of the mixed models that is used in 

numerous studies in the agricultural field. This approach is strengthened by the use of selection criteria of models, due to the estimation of 

parameters is based on methods of maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the

Bayesian information criterion (BIC) are described, permitting the optimum selection of competing mixed models. 


Key words: repeated measures, univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, mixed models, information criteria.

As pharmacogenetics researchers gather more detailed and complex data on gene 

polymorphisms that effect drug metabolizing enzymes, drug target receptors and drug 

transporters, they will need access to advanced statistical tools to mine that data. These 

tools include approaches from classical biostatistics, such as logistic regression or linear 

discriminant analysis, and supervised learning methods from computer science, such as 

support vector machines and artificial neural networks. In this review, we present an 

overview of another class of models, cluster analysis, which will likely be less familiar to 

pharmacogenetics researchers. Cluster analysis is used to analyze data that is not a priori 

known to contain any specific subgroups. The goal is to use the data itself to identify 

meaningful or informative subgroups. Specifically, we will focus on demonstrating the use 

of distance-based methods of hierarchical clustering to analyze gene expression data.

AAString-class AAString objects


Description


An AAString object allows efficient storage and manipulation of a long amino acid sequence.


Details


The AAString class is a direct XString subclass (with no additional slot). Therefore all functions

and methods described in the XString man page also work with an AAString object (inheritance).


Unlike the BString container that allows storage of any single string (based on a single-byte char-

acter set) the AAString container can only store a string based on the Amino Acid alphabet (see

below).


The Amino Acid alphabet


This alphabet contains all letters from the Single-Letter Amino Acid Code (see ?AMINO_ACID_CODE)

+ the stop ("*"), the gap ("-") and the hard masking ("+") letters. It is stored in the AA_ALPHABET

constant (character vector). The alphabet method also returns AA_ALPHABET when applied to

an AAString object and is provided for convenience only.


Constructor-like functions and generics


In the code snippet below, x can be a single string (character vector of length 1) or a BString object.


AAString(x="", start=1, nchar=NA): Tries to convert x into an AAString object by

reading nchar letters starting at position start in x.


Accessor methods


In the code snippet below, x is an AAString object.


alphabet(x): If x is an AAString object, then return the Amino Acid alphabet (see above).

See the corresponding man pages when x is a BString, DNAString or RNAString object.

We describe a bioinformatics approach, together with a freely accessible, interactive and flexible software termed Endeavour, to prioritize candidate genes underlying biological processes or diseases, based on their similarity to known genes involved in these phenomena. Unlike previous approaches, ours generates distinct prioritizations for multiple heterogeneous data sources, which are then integrated, or fused, into a global ranking using order statistics. In addition, it offers the flexibility of including additional data sources. Validation of our approach revealed it was able to efficiently prioritize 627 genes in disease data sets and 76 genes in biological pathway sets, identify candidates of 16 mono- or polygenic diseases, and discover regulatory genes of myeloid differentiation. Furthermore, the approach identified a novel gene involved in craniofacial development from a 2-Mb chromosomal region, deleted in some patients with DiGeorge-like birth defects. The approach described here offers an alternative integrative method for gene discovery.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: New tumor markers and markers of tumor progression are needed for improved staging and for better assessment of treatment of many cancers. Gene expression profiling techniques offer the opportunity to discover such markers. We investigated the feasibility of sample pooling strategy in combination with a novel analysis algorithm to identify markers. METHODS: Total RNA from human colon tumors (n = 60) of multiple stages (adenomas; cancers with modified Astler Collier stages B, C, and D; and liver metastases) were pooled within stages and compared with pooled normal mucosal specimens (n = 10) by using oligonucleotide expression arrays. Genes that showed consistent increases or decreases in their expression through tumor progression were identified. Northern blot analysis was used to validate the findings. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: More than 300 candidate tumor markers and more than 100 markers of tumor progression were identified. Northern analysis of 11 candidate tumor markers confirmed the gene expression changes. The gene for the secreted integrin-binding protein osteopontin was most consistently differentially expressed in conjunction with tumor progression. Its potential as a progression marker was validated (Spearman?s rho = 0.903; P<.001) with northern blot analysis using RNA from an independent set of 10 normal and 43 tumor samples representing all stages. Moreover, a statistically significant correlation between osteopontin protein expression and advancing tumor stage was identified with the use of 303 additional specimens (human cancer = 185, adenomas = 67, and normal mucosal specimens = 51) (Spearman's rho = 0.667; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Sample pooling can be a powerful, cost-effective, and rapid means of identifying the most common changes in a gene expression profile. We identified osteopontin as a clinically useful marker of tumor progression by use of gene expression profiling on pooled samples.},

  Abstract                 = {A goal of Johne?s disease control programs is to accurately detect Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infected cattle as quickly as possible to reduce disease transmission. A newly introduced real-time PCR provides results rapidly, but its accuracy in the field has not been evaluated. Fecal and serum samples collected from dairy cows in northern Indiana were used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of a newly licensed real-time PCR test for direct fecal detection of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Results of the real-time PCR were evaluated in parallel with solid and liquid media culture systems and a serum ELISA for detection of MAP antibodies to determine the accuracy of the real-time PCR and the tests' potential usefulness in the field. A total of 143 samples were tested by all four methods. Using prior published estimates for sensitivity and specificity of each of the tests and Bayesian methodology, the sensitivity and specificity of the real-time PCR test was estimated to be 0.60 and 0.97, respectively. The accuracy of real-time PCR (0.90) was comparable to both solid (0.91) and liquid (0.93) culture. Because real-time PCR accuracy is comparable to standard culture methods, it is a useful new test. In addition, test results are obtained as rapidly as an ELISA, but are more accurate than the ELISA (0.82). This makes real-time PCR an attractive test and should shorten the quarantine period required for new purchases of unknown MAP-status animals into herds participating in an MAP control program.},

Although the many procedures that are available might be bewildering to biologists who wish to apply them, statistical geneticists are recognizing commonalities among the different methods. Many are special cases of more general models, and points of consensus are emerging about the general approaches that warrant use and elaboration.},

One feature of microarray studies is the fact that the number n of samples collected is relatively small compared to the number p of genes per sample which are usually in the thousands. In statistical terms this very large number of predictors compared to a small number of samples or observations makes the classification problem difficult. An efficient way to solve this problem is by using dimension reduction statistical techniques in conjunction with nonparametric discriminant procedures. RESULTS: We view the classification problem as a regression problem with few observations and many predictor variables. We use an adaptive dimension reduction method for generalized semi-parametric regression models that allows us to solve the “curse of dimensionality problem” arising in the context of expression data. The predictive performance of the resulting classification rule is illustrated on two well know data sets in the microarray literature: the leukemia data that is known to contain classes that are easy “separable” and the colon data set.},

Frequently Asked Questions About HPLC-ECD


Listed below are some of the most frequently asked questions received concerning

Electrochemical detection with HPLC.


| Noisy baseline | Cleaning Cells | Shutdown Precautions | Long Term | Overnight | Filtering Mobile Phase |

| Baseline Fluctuations | pH Effects | Maximum Response | Nitric Acid Cleaning | Changing Filters | Valve


Troubleshooting |



What should I do if my baseline is noisy (fluctuating) and/or unstable (drifting).


Noisy or unstable baselines are typically associated with high background currents which can be caused by

many factors. Below is a list of some possible causes of high background currents within an high performance

liquid chromatography electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD) system as well as some causes of noise that

may not be due to high background currents. Keep in mind that this list includes only a few of the possible

causes. Remember there are no specific background currents that a cell should generate. The background

current is a result of assay conditions, system performance, cell age, and treatment of the cell.


Common sources of high background currents:


WATER! Water is extremely important in an HPLC-ECD system. Water must be of 18 megaohm-cm

resistance or higher. It is then recommended that this water be subjected to further cleaning, by a procedure

called water polishing. (Refer to ESA Technical Note "Water Polishing" p/n 70-1668).


Contaminated or impure chemicals used to make the mobile phase and/or preparation of samples. The

samples themselves also may be a source of contamination. Alumina or material from extractions may enter

the HPLC system and contaminate the column and electrodes.


EC active chemicals within the mobile phase, (e.g., EDTA, TEA). EDTA is commonly used in mobile phases to

chelate oxidizable metals, thereby lowering background currents. This compound is highly EC active at

>400mV. If working at > 400mV you should not use EDTA in the mobile phase; use citrate instead.

Triethylamine (TEA) is used to improve chromatographic peak shape. This additive tends to contain

electroactive impurities which may oxidize typically at high potentials. Use minimal amounts of TEA, typically

<100µL/L or base-deactivated HPLC columns.


Stainless steel tubing within the system may corrode. The release of contaminants or the presence of

corrosion sites within the system can cause cell fouling and/or high background currents. Customers with

stainless steel tubing are advised to passivate their system regularly or use PEEK tubing. This tubing can be

purchased directly from ESA.


A ruptured pulse damper can leach contaminants into the system typically causing increased background

currents and/or pressure to rise over time.


Other sources of noise or drift:


Dissolved gases in the pump head. Fluctuation in pump pressure is normally associated with this problem.

Ensure that the mobile phase is properly degassed. Stop the pumps, allow the pressure to bleed off and then

purge the pump(s) for 30 second. Degas mobile phase prior to running on the system (For further details see

item 6 below).


Dissolved gases in the detector cell. Ensure that the mobile phase is thoroughly degassed.


Specific to cells with purge ports (for cell Model#s 5014B and 5041) is the possibility that the cell was not

purged properly before use.

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: DNA microarrays are now capable of providing genome-wide patterns of gene expression across many different conditions. The first level of analysis of these patterns requires determining whether observed differences in expression are significant or not. Current methods are unsatisfactory due to the lack of a systematic framework that can accommodate noise, variability, and low replication often typical of microarray data. Results: We develop a Bayesian probabilistic framework for microarray data analysis. At the simplest level, we model log-expression values by independent normal distributions, parameterized by corresponding means and variances with hierarchical prior distributions. We derive point estimates for both parameters and hyperparameters, and regularized expressions for the variance of each gene by combining the empirical variance with a local background variance associated with neighboring genes. An additional hyperparameter, inversely related to the number of empirical observations, determines the strength of the background variance. Simulations show that these point estimates, combined with a t-test, provide a systematic inference approach that compares favorably with simple t-test or fold methods, and partly compensate for the lack of replication.},

  Abstractnote             = {Partial least squares (PLS) was not originally designed as a tool for statistical discrimination. In spite of this, applied scientists routinely use PLS for classification and there is substantial empirical evidence to suggest that it performs well in that role. The interesting question is: why can a procedure that is principally designed for overdetermined regression problems locate and emphasize group structure? Using PLS in this manner has heurestic support owing to the relationship between PLS and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and the relationship, in turn, between CCA and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This paper replaces the heuristics with a formal statistical explanation. As a consequence, it will become clear that PLS is to be preferred over PCA when discrimination is the goal and dimension reduction is needed. Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstractnote             = {Constantly improving gene expression profiling technologies are expected to provide understanding and insight into cancer-related cellular processes. Gene expression data is also expected to significantly aid in the development of efficient cancer diagnosis and classification platforms. In this work we examine three sets of gene expression data measured across sets of tumor(s) and normal clinical samples: The first set consists of 2,000 genes, measured in 62 epithelial colon samples (Alon et al., 1999). The second consists of approximately equal to 100,000 clones, measured in 32 ovarian samples (unpublished extension of data set described in Schummer et al. (1999)). The third set consists of approximately equal to 7,100 genes, measured in 72 bone marrow and peripheral blood samples (Golub et al, 1999). We examine the use of scoring methods, measuring separation of tissue type (e.g., tumors from normals) using individual gene expression levels. These are then coupled with high-dimensional classification methods to assess the classification power of complete expression profiles. We present results of performing leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) experiments on the three data sets, employing nearest neighbor classifier, SVM (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995), AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire, 1997) and a novel clustering-based classification technique. As tumor samples can differ from normal samples in their cell-type composition, we also perform LOOCV experiments using appropriately modified sets of genes, attempting to eliminate the resulting bias. We demonstrate success rate of at least 90% in tumor versus normal classification, using sets of selected genes, with, as well as without, cellular-contamination-related members. These results are insensitive to the exact selection mechanism, over a certain range},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

In this paper, the classification procedure consisting of PLS dimension reduction and linear discriminant analysis on the new components is compared with some of the best state-of-the-art classification methods. Moreover, a boosting algorithm is applied to this classification method. In addition, a simple procedure to choose the number of PLS components is suggested. The connection between PLS dimension reduction and gene selection is examined and a property of the first PLS component for binary classification is proved. In addition, we show how PLS can be used for data visualization using real data. The whole study is based on 9 real microarray cancer data sets.},

  Abstractnote             = {MOTIVATION: Microarray classification typically possesses two striking attributes: (1) classifier design and error estimation are based on remarkably small samples and (2) cross-validation error estimation is employed in the majority of the papers. Thus, it is necessary to have a quantifiable understanding of the behavior of cross-validation in the context of very small samples. RESULTS: An extensive simulation study has been performed comparing cross-validation, resubstitution and bootstrap estimation for three popular classification rules-linear discriminant analysis, 3-nearest-neighbor and decision trees (CART)-using both synthetic and real breast-cancer patient data. Comparison is via the distribution of differences between the estimated and true errors. Various statistics for the deviation distribution have been computed: mean (for estimator bias), variance (for estimator precision), root-mean square error (for composition of bias and variance) and quartile ranges, including outlier behavior. In general, while cross-validation error estimation is much less biased than resubstitution, it displays excessive variance, which makes individual estimates unreliable for small samples. Bootstrap methods provide improved performance relative to variance, but at a high computational cost and often with increased bias (albeit, much less than with resubstitution).},

  Abstractnote             = {We introduce a method of functionally classifying genes by using gene expression data from DNA microarray hybridization experiments. The method is based on the theory of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are considered a supervised computer learning method because they exploit prior knowledge of gene function to identify unknown genes of similar function from expression data. SVMs avoid several problems associated with unsupervised clustering methods, such as hierarchical clustering and self-organizing maps. SVMs have many mathematical features that make them attractive for gene expression analysis, including their flexibility in choosing a similarity function, sparseness of solution when dealing with large data sets, the ability to handle large feature spaces, and the ability to identify outliers. We test several SVMs that use different similarity metrics, as well as some other supervised learning methods, and find that the SVMs best identify sets of genes with a common function using expression data. Finally, we use SVMs to predict functional roles for uncharacterized yeast ORFs based on their expression data.},

  Abstractnote             = {Background: As real-time quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR) is increasingly being relied upon for the enforcement of legislation and regulations dependent upon the trace detection of DNA, focus has increased on the quality issues related to the technique. Recent work has focused on the identification of factors that contribute towards significant measurement uncertainty in the real-time quantitative PCR technique, through investigation of the experimental design and operating procedure. However, measurement uncertainty contributions made during the data analysis procedure have not been studied in detail. This paper presents two additional approaches for standardising data analysis through the novel application of statistical methods to RT-QPCR, in order to minimise potential uncertainty in results. Results: Experimental data was generated in order to develop the two aspects of data handling and analysis that can contribute towards measurement uncertainty in results. This paper describes preliminary aspects in standardising data through the application of statistical techniques to the area of RT-QPCR. The first aspect concerns the statistical identification and subsequent handling of outlying values arising from RT-QPCR, and discusses the implementation of ISO guidelines in relation to acceptance or rejection of outlying values. The second aspect relates to the development of an objective statistical test for the comparison of calibration curves. Conclusion: The preliminary statistical tests for outlying values and comparisons between calibration curves can be applied using basic functions found in standard spreadsheet software. These two aspects emphasise that the comparability of results arising from RT-QPCR needs further refinement and development at the data-handling phase. The implementation of standardised approaches to data analysis should further help minimise variation due to subjective judgements. The aspects described in this paper will help contribute towards the development of a set of best practice guidelines regarding standardising handling and interpretation of data arising from RT-QPCR experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate diagnosis of thyroid tumors is challenging. A particular problem is distinguishing between follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) and benign follicular thyroid adenoma (FTA), where histology of fine-needle aspirates is not conclusive. It is often necessary to remove healthy thyroid to rule out carcinoma. In order to find markers to improve diagnosis, we quantified gene transcript expression from FTC, FTA, and normal thyroid, revealing 73 differentially expressed transcripts (P < or = 0.0001). Using an independent set of 23 FTCs, FTAs, and matched normal thyroids, 17 genes with large expression differences were tested by real-time RT-PCR. Four genes (DDIT3, ARG2, ITM1, and C1orf24) differed between the two classes FTC and FTA, and a linear combination of expression levels distinguished FTC from FTA with an estimated predictive accuracy of 0.83. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry for DDIT3 and ARG2 showed consistent staining for carcinoma in an independent set 59 follicular tumors (estimated concordance, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.59, 0.93). A simple test based on a combination of these markers might improve preoperative diagnosis of thyroid nodules, allowing better treatment decisions and reducing long-term health costs.},

  Abstractnote             = {Background: Expression microarrays are increasingly used to obtain large scale transcriptomic information on a wide range of biological samples. Nevertheless, there is still much debate on the best ways to process data, to design experiments and analyse the output. Furthermore, many of the more sophisticated mathematical approaches to data analysis in the literature remain inaccessible to much of the biological research community. In this study we examine ways of extracting and analysing a large data set obtained using the Agilent long oligonucleotide transcriptomics platform, applied to a set of human macrophage and dendritic cell samples. Results: We describe and validate a series of data extraction, transformation and normalisation steps which are implemented via a new R function. Analysis of replicate normalised reference data demonstrate that intrarray variability is small (only around 2% of the mean log signal), while interarray variability from replicate array measurements has a standard deviation (SD) of around 0.5 log2 units 6% of mean). The common practise of working with ratios of Cy5/Cy3 signal offers little further improvement in terms of reducing error. Comparison to expression data obtained using Arabidopsis samples demonstrates that the large number of genes in each sample showing a low level of transcription reflect the real complexity of the cellular transcriptome. Multidimensional scaling is used to show that the processed data identifies an underlying structure which reflect some of the key biological variables which define the data set. This structure is robust, allowing reliable comparison of samples collected over a number of years and collected by a variety of operators. Conclusions: This study outlines a robust and easily implemented pipeline for extracting, transforming normalising and visualising transcriptomic array data from Agilent expression platform. The analysis is used to obtain quantitative estimates of the SD arising from experimental (non biological) intra- and interarray variability, and for a lower threshold for determining whether an individual gene is expressed.

ABSTRACT


Mechanisms have evolved to help protect our genetic material from

endogenous and exogenous damage that are vital for an organism’s sur-

vival. This ability to recognize damaged DNA and simultaneously regu-

late cell cycle progression and DNArepair is critical for genomic stability,

and defects in these pathways are hallmarks of cancer. The DNA dam-

age response pathway is a multi-component signal transduction network

that consists of a multitude of proteins whose functions are still under

investigation. This review will focus on the current ?ndings in the ?eld

including how the DNA damage response in?uences cancer predisposi-

tion and formation.


1. INTRODUCTION


Safeguarding an organism’s genome from endogenous (reactive

oxygen species, abnormal replication intermediates) and exogenous

(UV and ionizing radiation, reactive chemicals) sources of DNA

damage insures timely and accurate passage of genetic informa-

tion onto daughter cells. Cells have evolved an elaborate surveil-

lance system to respond to these harmful stimuli. These surveillance

pathways are called cell cycle checkpoints, which are activated upon

detection of DNA damage, thus allowing the repair of the genetic

  Abstractnote             = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Many researchers are concerned with the comparability and reliability of microarray gene expression data. Recent completion of the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project provides a unique opportunity to assess reproducibility across multiple sites and the comparability across multiple platforms. The MAQC analysis presented for the conclusion of inter- and intra-platform of microarray gene expression measurements is inadequate. We evaluate the of the MAQC data for 12901 common genes in four titration samples generated from five high-density one-color microarray platforms and the TaqMan technology. We discuss some of the problems with the use of correlation coefficient as metric to evaluate the inter- and intra-platform reproducibility and the percent of overlapping genes (POG) as a measure for evaluation of a gene selection procedure by MAQC. RESULTS: A total of 293 arrays is used in the intra- and inter-platform analysis. A hierarchical cluster analysis shows distinct differences in the measured intensities among the five platforms. A number of genes show a small fold-change in one platform and a large fold-change in another platform, even though the correlations between platforms are high. An analysis of variance shows thirty percent of gene expressions of the samples show inconsistent patterns across the five platforms. We illustrated that POG does not reflect the accuracy of a selected gene list. A non-overlapping gene can be truly differentially expressed with a stringent cut, and an overlapping gene can be non-differentially expressed with non-stringent cutoff. In addition, POG is an unusable selection criterion. POG can increase or decrease irregularly as cutoff changes; there is no criterion to determine a cutoff so that POG is optimized. CONCLUSIONS: Using various statistical methods we demonstrate that there are differences in the intensities measured by different platforms and different sites within platform. Within each platform, the patterns of expression are generally consistent, but there is site-by-site variability. Evaluation of data analysis methods for use in regulatory decision should take no treatment effect into consideration, when there is no treatment effect, “a fold-change cutoff with a non-stringent p-value cutoff” could result in 100% false positive error selection.},

  Abstract                 = {Cdx-2 is a transactivator for the proglucagon gene in pancreatic and intestinal endocrine cells. Cdx-2 is also expressed in differentiated intestinal epithelia of nonendocrine origin. Cdx-2-/- mice are embryonic lethal, while Cdx-2+/- mutants show multiple malfunctions including the formation of intestinal polyps. Within the polyps, the remaining wild type Cdx-2 allele ceases its expression, while the expression of both Cdx-2 and proglucagon in the endocrine cells remains unaltered, indicating that Cdx-2 could be haplo-insufficient for nonendocrine cells, but not for proglucagon producing endocrine cells. We propose that mechanisms underlying Cdx-2 expression and auto-regulation Xu F, Li H & Jin T (1999), J Biol Chem274, 34310-34316 differ in these two types of cells. We show here that forskolin and cAMP upregulate Cdx-2 expression in proglucagon producing cells, but not in colon cancer cells and primary intestinal cell cultures. It is unlikely that the activation is mainly mediated by PKA, because the activation was observed in a PKA deficient cell line. Co-transfecting a dominant negative Ras expression plasmid substantially repressed the Cdx-2 promoter, in contrast to a previous finding that Ras is a negative factor for Cdx-2 expression in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, forskolin activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the endocrine cells, and attenuation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by its inhibitor is associated with attenuated Cdx-2 expression. Finally, an Epac pathway specific cAMP analogue stimulated both ERK1/2 phosphorylation and Cdx-2 expression. Taken together, our observations suggest that Cdx-2 expression is regulated by the second messenger cAMP, cell-type specifically, via the Epac pathway.},

The proposed methodology advocates analytic parameter selection directly from the training data, rather than re-sampling approaches commonly used in SVM applications. In particular, we describe a new analytical prescription for setting the value of insensitive zone epsilon, as a function of training sample size. Good generalization performance of the proposed parameter selection is demonstrated empirically using several low- and high-dimensional regression problems. Further, we point out the importance of Vapnik?s epsilon-insensitive loss for regression problems with finite samples. To this end, we compare generalization performance of SVM regression (using proposed selection of epsilon-values) with regression using “least-modulus” loss (epsilon=0) and standard squared loss. These comparisons indicate superior generalization performance of SVM regression under sparse sample settings, for various types of additive noise.},

The purpose of this paper is to explore the nature of the VIP method and to compare with other methods through computer simulation experiments. We design 108 experiments where observations are generated from true models considering four factors-the proportion of the number of relevant predictors, the magnitude of correlations between predictors, the structure of regression coefficients, and the magnitude of signal to noise. Confusion matrix is adopted to evaluate the performance of PLS, the Lasso, and stepwise method. We also discuss the proper cutoff value of the VIP method to increase its performance. Some practical hints for the use of the VIP method are given as simulation results.},

The method chosen for data analysis can strongly influence results of the quantification. Results: To compare the performance of six techniques which are currently used for analysing fluorescent data in real-time PCR relative quantification, we quantified four cytokine transcripts (IL-1 , IL-6 TNF- , and GM-CSF) in an in vivo model of colonic inflammation. Accuracy of the methods was tested by quantification on samples with known relative amounts of target mRNAs. Reproducibility of the methods was estimated by the determination of the intra-assay and inter-assay variability. Cytokine expression normalized to the expression of three reference genes (ACTB, HPRT, SDHA) was then determined using the six methods for data analysis. The best results were obtained with the relative standard curve method, comparative Ct method and with DART-PCR, LinRegPCR and Liu & Saint exponential methods when average amplification efficiency was used. The use of individual amplification efficiencies in DART-PCR, LinRegPCR and Liu & Saint exponential methods significantly impaired the results. The sigmoid curve-fitting (SCF) method produced medium performance; the results indicate that the use of appropriate type of fluorescence data and in some instances manual selection of the number of amplification cycles included in the analysis is necessary when the SCF method is applied. We also compared amplification efficiencies (E) and found that although the E values determined by different methods of analysis were not identical, all the methods were capable to identify two genes whose E values significantly differed from other genes. Conclusion: Our results show that all the tested methods can provide quantitative values reflecting the amounts of measured mRNA in samples, but they differ in their accuracy and reproducibility. Selection of the appropriate method can also depend on the design of a particular experiment. The advantages and disadvantages of the methods in different applications are discussed.},

Abstract


In this note, we explain how f(a) = log(1? e?a) = log(1? exp(?a)) can be computed

accurately, in a simple and optimal manner, building on the two related auxiliary functions

log1p(x) (= log(1 + x)) and expm1(x) (= exp(x)? 1 = ex ? 1). The cutoff, a0, in use in

R since 2004, is shown to be optimal both theoretically and empirically(, using)Rmpfr high

precision arithmetic. As an aside, we also show how to compute log 1 + ex accurately

and efficiently.


Keywords: Accuracy, Cancellation Error, R, MPFR, Rmpfr.


1. Introduction: Not log() nor exp(), but log1p() and expm1()


In applied mathematics, it has been known for a very long time that direct computation of

log(1+ x) suffers from severe cancellation (in “1+ x”) whenever |x| ? 1, and for that reason,

we have provided log1p(x) in R, since R version 1.0.0 (released, Feb. 29, 2000). Similarly,

log1p() has been provided by C math libraries and has become part of C language standards

around the same time, see, for example, IEEE and Open Group (2004).


Analogously, since R 1.5.0 (April 2002), the function expm1(x) computes exp(x)? 1 = ex? 1

accurately also for |x| ? 1, where ex ? 1 is (partially) cancelled by “? 1”.

Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) western-blot technique was employed to evaluate the antigenic specificity of CSF-IgG towards individual T. gondii antigens. PCR was positive in all TE patients which displayed brain-derived or blood-derived specific OCB, even when comparative ASI failed. Four TE patients had a unique anti-T. gondii OCB restricted to the CSF and a strong antibody response toward the 29 kDa band by ECL western blot. This response could be an important marker to discriminate TE from other opportunistic central nervous system (CNS) infections in the course of AIDS.},

However, the best methods for conducting such experiments and analyzing the resultant data remain an issue of discussion. In this report we describe an appropriate experimental methodology and the computer programs necessary to generate a meaningful statistical analysis of the combined biological and experimental variability in such experiments. Specifically, logarithmic transformations of raw fluorescence data from the log-linear portion of real-time PCR growth curves for both target and reference genes are analyzed using a SAS/STAT Mixed Procedure program specifically designed to give a point estimate of the relative expression ratio of the target gene with associated 95% confidence interval. The program code is open-source and is printed in the text.},

This is a bonanza for the statistical geneticist, who can create probeset summaries with specific characteristics. There are now several methods available for summarizing probe level data from the popular Affymetrix GeneChips, but it is difficult to identify the best method for a given inquiry. RESULTS: We have developed a graphical tool to evaluate summaries of Affymetrix probe level data. Plots and summary statistics offer a picture of how an expression measure performs in several important areas. This picture facilitates the comparison of competing expression measures and the selection of methods suitable for a specific investigation. The key is a benchmark data set consisting of a dilution study and a spike-in study. Because the truth is known for these data, we can identify statistical features of the data for which the expected outcome is known in advance. Those features highlighted in our suite of graphs are justified by questions of biological interest and motivated by the presence of appropriate data.},

This rule is independent of the underlying joint distribution on the sample points and their classifications, and hence the probability of errorRof such a rule must be at least as great as the Bayes probability of errorR^ast-the minimum probability of error over all decision rules taking underlying probability structure into account. However, in a large sample analysis, we will show in theM-category case thatR^ast leq R leq R^ast(2 -MR^ast/(M-1)), where these bounds are the tightest possible, for all suitably smooth underlying distributions. Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error. In this sense, it may be said that half the classification information in an infinite sample set is contained in the nearest neighbor.},

1. Introduction


This paper details the results of linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant

analysis (QDA) and logistic regression to classify three data sets. In these experiments, we are

interested in classifying data into discrete classes. To investigate each of these classifications

methods, we first use randomly generated data that is one dimensional. One dimensional data

allows us to easily visualize the data and the boundaries that are created by the classification

methods to separate the data. Next we examine the results of each classification method on

two dimensional data. The extra dimension makes it more difficult to visual the data and

the created separation boundaries, though it’s still possibly to visual the results. Finally, we},

  Abstract                 = {Genome-wide expression profiling is a powerful tool for implicating novel gene ensembles in cellular mechanisms of health and disease. The most popular platform for genome-wide expression profiling is the Affymetrix GeneChip. However, its selection of probes relied on earlier genome and transcriptome annotation which is significantly different from current knowledge. The resultant informatics problems have a profound impact on analysis and interpretation the data. Here, we address these critical issues and offer a solution. We identified several classes of problems at the individual probe level in the existing annotation, under the assumption that current genome and transcriptome databases are more accurate than those used for GeneChip design. We then reorganized probes on more than a dozen popular GeneChips into gene-, transcript- and exon-specific probe sets in light of up-to-date genome, cDNA/EST clustering and single nucleotide polymorphism information. Comparing analysis results between the original and the redefined probe sets reveals [\~{}]30-50\% discrepancy in the genes previously identified as differentially expressed, regardless of analysis method. Our results demonstrate that the original Affymetrix probe set definitions are inaccurate, and many conclusions derived from past GeneChip analyses may be significantly flawed. It will be beneficial to re-analyze existing GeneChip data with updated probe set definitions. 10.1093/nar/gni179},

  Abstractnote             = {Background: The use of microarray technology to assess gene expression levels is now widespread in biology. The validation of microarray results using independent mRNA quantitation techniques remains a desirable element of any microarray experiment. To facilitate the comparison of microarray expression data between laboratories it is essential that validation methodologies be critically examined. We have assessed the correlation between expression scores obtained for 48 human genes using oligonucleotide microarrays and the expression levels for the same genes measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Results: Correlations with qRT-PCR data were obtained using microarray data that were processed using robust multi-array analysis (RMA) and the MAS 5.0 algorithm. Our results indicate that when identical transcripts are targeted by the two methods, correlations between qRT-PCR and microarray data are generally strong (r = 0.89). However, we observed poor correlations between qRT-PCR and RMA or MAS 5.0 normalized microarray data for 13% or 16% of genes, respectively. Conclusion: These results highlight the complementarity of oligonucleotide microarray and qRT-PCR technologies for validation of gene expression measurements, while emphasizing the continuing requirement for caution in interpreting gene expression data.},

A novel algorithm for partial least squares (PLS) regression, SIMPLS, is proposed which calculates the PLS factors directly as linear combinations of the original variables. The PLS factors are determined such as to maximize a covariance criterion, while obeying certain orthogonality and normalization restrictions. This approach follows that of other traditional multivariate methods. The construction of deflated data matrices as in the nonlinear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS)-PLS algorithm is avoided. For univariate y SIMPLS is equivalent to PLS1 and closely related to existing bidiagonalization algorithms. This follows from an analysis of PLS1 regression in terms of Krylov sequences. For multivariate Y there is a slight difference between the SIMPLS approach and NIPALS-PLS2. In practice the SIMPLS algorithm appears to be fast and easy to interpret as it does not involve a breakdown of the data sets.},

Many different approaches and methodological developments have been put forward, yet the question remains open. RESULTS: Varmixt is a powerful and efficient novel methodology for this task. It is based on a flexible and realistic variance modelling strategy. It compares favourably with other popular techniques (standard t-test, SAM and Cyber-T). The relevance of the approach is demonstrated with real-world and simulated datasets. The analysis strategy was successfully applied to both a “two-colour” cDNA microarray and an Affymetrix Genechip. Strong control of false positive and false negative rates is proven in large simulation studies.

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this paper is to correlate the molecular phenotype of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) to their biological pathology. We hybridized 26 PTC on microarrays and showed that nearly 44% of the transcriptome was regulated in these tumors. We then combined our data set with two published PTC microarray studies to produce a platform- and study-independent list of PTC-associated genes. We further confirmed the mRNA regulation of 15 genes from this list by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Analysis of this list with statistical tools led to several conclusions: (1) there is a change in cell population with an increased expression of genes involved in the immune response, reflecting lymphocyte infiltration in the tumor compared to the normal tissue. (2) The c-jun N-terminal kinase pathway is activated by overexpression of its components. (3) The activation of ERKK1/2 by genetic alterations is supplemented by activation of the epidermal growth factor but not of the insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway. (4) There is a downregulation of immediate early genes. (5) We observed an overexpression of many proteases in accordance with tumor remodeling, and suggested a probable role of S100 proteins and annexin A2 in this process. (6) Numerous overexpressed genes favor the hypothesis of a collective migration mode of tumor cells.},

This document is intended to assist an individual who has familiarity with R and who is taking a

survival analysis course. Specifically, this was constructed for a biostatistics course at UCLA. Many

theoretical details have been intentionally omitted for brevity; it is assumed the reader is familiar

with the theory of the topics presented. Likewise, it is assumed the reader has basic understanding

of R including working with data frames, vectors, matrices, plotting, and linear model fitting and

interpretation.


Functions that are introduced will only have the key arguments mentioned and discussed. Most

functions have several other (optional) arguments, however, many of these will not be useful for

an introductory course. The functions, with the exception of those I wrote, have well-written

descriptions that specify each of the potential arguments and their use. The functions I have

written include documentation on the following web site:


<http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~david/teac/surv/>


Ideally, this survival analysis document would be printed front-to-back and bound like a book. No

topics run over two pages and those that are two pages would then be on opposing pages, making

a topic’s introduction available without the need to flip back and forth between pages (unless the

reader forgets a previous topic, then some flipping may be necessary). A more thorough look at

Cox PH models beyond what is discussed here is available in a guide constructed by John Fox,

which is listed in the References.

  Abstract                 = {Microarray analysis has become a popular and routine method in functional genomics. It is typical for such experiments to involve a small number of replicates, which causes unreliable estimates of the sample variance. Microarrays have fostered the development of new statistical methods to analyze data resulting from experiments with small sample sizes. In this study, we tackle the problem of evaluating the performance of statistical tests for generating ranked gene lists from two-channel direct comparisons. We propose an evaluation method based on a oligonucleotide microarray with a large number of replicate spots yielding a maximum of 400 replicates per gene. We apply Spearman?s rank correlation coefficient to ranked gene-lists generated by eight widely used microarray specific test statistics, which are applied to small random samples. We could show that variance stabilizing methods such as Cyber-T, SAM, and LIMMA can be beneficial for very small sample sizes and that SAM and the t-test provide stronger control of the type I error rate than the other methods. Specifically, we report that for four replicates all methods reach a high to very high correlation with our reference standard.},

  Abstract                 = {DNA microarrays are part of a new and promising class of biotechnologies that allow the monitoring of expression levels in cells for thousands of genes simultaneously. An important and common question in DNA microarray experiments is the identification of differentially expressed genes, that is, genes whose expression levels are associated with a response or covariate of interest. The biological question of differential expression can be restated as a problem in multiple hypothesis testing: the simultaneous test for each gene of the null hypothesis of no association between the expression levels and the responses or covariates. As a typical microarray experiment measures expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously, large multiplicity problems are generated. This article discusses different approaches to multiple hypothesis testing in the context of DNA microarray experiments and compares the procedures on microarray and simulated data sets.},

Although numerous statistical tools are available in the public domain for the analysis of microarray experiments, this is not the case for qPCR. Proprietary software is typically provided by instrument manufacturers, but these solutions are not amenable to the tandem analysis of multiple assays. This is problematic when an experiment involves more than a simple comparison between a control and treatment sample, or when many qPCR datasets are to be analyzed in a high-throughput facility. Results: We have developed HTqPCR, a package for the R statistical computing environment, to enable the processing and analysis of qPCR data across multiple conditions and replicates.

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Predicting the metastatic potential of primary malignant tissues has direct bearing on the choice of therapy. Several microarray studies yielded gene sets whose expression profiles successfully predicted survival. Nevertheless, the overlap between these gene sets is almost zero. Such small overlaps were observed also in other complex diseases, and the variables that could account for the differences had evoked a wide interest. One of the main open questions in this context is whether the disparity can be attributed only to trivial reasons such as different technologies, different patients and different types of analyses. Results: To answer this question, we concentrated on a single breast cancer dataset, and analyzed it by a single method, the one which was used by van't Veer et al. to produce a set of outcome-predictive genes. We showed that, in fact, the resulting set of genes is not unique; it is strongly influenced by the subset of patients used for gene selection. Many equally predictive lists could have been produced from the same analysis. Three main properties of the data explain this sensitivity: (1) many genes are correlated with survival; (2) the differences between these correlations are small; (3) the correlations fluctuate strongly when measured over different subsets of patients. A possible biological explanation for these properties is discussed.

  Abstractnote             = {Predicting at the time of discovery the prognosis and metastatic potential of cancer is a major challenge in current clinical research. Numerous recent studies searched for gene expression signatures that outperform traditionally used clinical parameters in outcome prediction. Finding such a signature will free many patients of the suffering and toxicity associated with adjuvant chemotherapy given to them under current protocols, even though they do not need such treatment. A reliable set of predictive genes also will contribute to a better understanding of the biological mechanism of metastasis. Several groups have published lists of predictive genes and reported good predictive performance based on them. However, the gene lists obtained for the same clinical types of patients by different groups differed widely and had only very few genes in common. This lack of agreement raised doubts about the reliability and robustness of the reported predictive gene lists, and the main source of the problem was shown to be the small number of samples that were used to generate the gene lists. Here, we introduce a previously undescribed mathematical method, probably approximately correct (PAC) sorting, for evaluating the robustness of such lists. We calculate for several published data sets the number of samples that are needed to achieve any desired level of reproducibility. For example, to achieve a typical overlap of 50% between two predictive lists of genes, breast cancer studies would need the expression profiles of several thousand early discovery patients.},

For each of these latter distance measures: we show that it is “almost” a metric in the following two seemingly unrelated aspects:step-(i) it satisfies a relaxed version of the polygonal (hence, triangle) inequality, andstep-(ii) there is a metric with positive constant multiples that bounds our measure above and below.This is not a coincidence--we show that these two notions of almost being a metric are the same. Based on the second notion, we define two distance measures to be equivalent if they are bounded above and below by constant multiples of each other. We thereby identify a large and robust equivalence class of distance measures.Besides the applications to the task of identifying good notions of (dis-)similarity between two top k lists, our results imply polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithms for the rank aggregation problem with respect to a large class of distance measures.},

  Abstract                 = {Relaxin (RLN) is a small peptide hormone expressed in several cancers of reproductive and endocrine organs. Increased expression of RLN in prostate cancer correlates with aggressive cancer. RLN G-protein-coupled receptor (RLN family peptide receptor 1, RXFP1) is expressed in both androgen receptor (AR)-positive and -negative prostate cancers as well as in prostate cancer cell lines. RLN behaves as a cell growth factor and increases invasiveness and proliferation of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The objective of this study is to determine whether downregulation of RXFP1 expression using small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduces cancer growth and metastasis in a xenograft model of prostate cancer. We used two well-characterized prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines, AR-positive LNCaP cells and AR-negative PC3 cells. The tumors were established in nude male mice by s.c. injections. Intratumoral injections of siRNAs loaded on biodegradable chitosan nanoparticles led to a downregulation of RXFP1 receptor expression and a dramatic reduction in tumor growth. In LNCaP tumors, the siRNA treatment led to an extensive necrosis. In PC3 xenografts treated with siRNA against RXFP1, the smaller tumor size was associated with the decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The downregulation of RXFP1 resulted in significant decrease in metastasis rate in PC3 tumors. Global transcriptional profiling of PC3 cells treated with RXFP1 siRNA revealed genes with significantly altered expression profiles previously shown to promote tumorigenesis, including the downregulation of MCAM, MUC1, ANGPTL4, GPI, and TSPAN8. Thus, the suppression of RLN/RXFP1 may have potential therapeutic benefits in prostate cancer.},

  Abstractnote             = {Background: Improvements in genome sequence annotation revealed discrepancies in the original probeset/gene assignment in Affymetrix microarray and the existence of differences between annotations and effective alignments of probes and transcription products. In the current generation of Affymetrix human GeneChips, most probesets include probes matching transcripts from more than one gene and probes which do not match any transcribed sequence. Results: We developed a novel set of custom Chip Definition Files (CDF) and the corresponding Bioconductor libraries for Affymetrix human GeneChips, based on the information contained in the GeneAnnot database. GeneAnnot-based CDFs are composed of unique custom-probesets, including only probes matching a single gene. Conclusion: GeneAnnot-based custom CDFs solve the problem of a reliable reconstruction of expression levels and eliminate the existence of more than one probeset per gene, which often leads to discordant expression signals for the same transcript when gene differential expression is the focus of the analysis. GeneAnnot CDFs are freely distributed and fully compliant with Affymetrix standards and all available software for gene expression analysis. The CDF libraries are available from , along with supplementary information (CDF libraries, installation guidelines and R code, CDF statistics, and analysis results).},

  Abstract                 = {FXYD proteins have been proposed to function as regulators of Na, K-ATPase function by lowering affinities of the system for potassium and sodium. However, their distribution in normal human tissues has not been studied. We have therefore used immunohistochemistry and semi-quantitative histomorphometric analysis to determine the relative expression at the protein level and distribution of FXYD1 (phospholemman) and FXYD2 (gamma subunit of Na, K-ATPase) in human Tissue MicroArrays (TMAs). Expression of FXYD1 was abundant in heart, kidney, placenta, skeletal muscle, gastric and anal mucosa, small intestine and colon. Lower FXYD1 expression was detected in uterine, intestinal and bladder smooth muscle, choroid plexus, liver, gallbladder, spleen, breast, prostate and epididymis. The tissue distribution of FXYD2 was less extensive compared to that of FXYD1. There was an abundant expression in kidney and choroid plexus and moderate expression in placenta, amniotic membranes, breast epithelium, salivary glands, pancreas and uterine endometrium. Weaker FXYD2 expression was detected in the adrenal medulla, liver, gallbladder, bladder and pancreas. The common denominator in the distribution of FXYD1 and FXYD2 was expression in highly active transport epithelia of the kidney, choroid plexus, placenta and salivary glands. This study reveals, in human tissues, the specific expression of FXYD proteins, which may associate with Na, K-ATPase in selected cell types and modulate its catalytic properties.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Determining whether a gene is differentially expressed in two different samples remains an important statistical problem. Prior work in this area has featured the use of t-tests with pooled estimates of the sample variance based on similarly expressed genes. These methods do not display consistent behavior across the entire range of pooling and can be biased when the prior hyperparameters are specified heuristically. Results: A two-sample Bayesian t-test is proposed for use in determining whether a gene is differentially expressed in two different samples. The test method is an extension of earlier work that made use of point estimates for the variance. The method proposed here explicitly calculates in analytic form the marginal distribution for the difference in the mean expression of two samples, obviating the need for point estimates of the variance without recourse to posterior simulation. The prior distribution involves a single hyperparameter that can be calculated in a statistically rigorous manner, making clear the connection between the prior degrees of freedom and prior variance. Conclusion: The test is easy to understand and implement and application to both real and simulated data shows that the method has equal or greater power compared to the previous method and demonstrates consistent Type I error rates. The test is generally applicable outside the microarray field to any situation where prior information about the variance is available and is not limited to cases where estimates of the variance are based on many similar observations.},

  Abstractnote             = {MOTIVATION: Estimation of misclassification error has received increasing attention in clinical diagnosis and bioinformatics studies, especially in small sample studies with microarray data. Current error estimation methods are not satisfactory because they either have large variability (such as leave-one-out cross-validation) or large bias (such as resubstitution and leave-one-out bootstrap). While small sample size remains one of the key features of costly clinical investigations or of microarray studies that have limited resources in funding, time and tissue materials, accurate and easy-to-implement error estimation methods for small samples are desirable and will be beneficial. RESULTS: A bootstrap cross-validation method is studied. It achieves accurate error estimation through a simple procedure with bootstrap resampling and only costs computer CPU time. Simulation studies and applications to microarray data demonstrate that it performs consistently better than its competitors. This method possesses several attractive properties: (1) it is implemented through a simple procedure; (2) it performs well for small samples with sample size, as small as 16; (3) it is not restricted to any particular classification rules and thus applies to many parametric or non-parametric methods.},

  Abstract                 = {We previously found frequent loss of heterozygosity at 12q21 and 12q22-q23.1 in primary pancreatic cancers, and the DUSP6/MKP-3 gene residing in this region at 12q22 lost its expression in the great majority of pancreatic cancer cell lines. The DUSP6/MKP-3 protein is a dual-specificity phosphatase that dephosphorylates the active form of ERK, making a feedback loop to control ERK activity. Gain-of-function mutations of KRAS2 occur in the great majority of pancreatic cancer cells, and loss of expression of DUSP6/MKP-3 may synergistically promote constitutive activation of ERK and uncontrolled cell growth. To study loss of the feedback pathway and its impact on pancreatic cancer cell growth, we first investigated the expression of DUSP6/MKP-3 in primary pancreatic cancer tissues immunohistochemically; we found up-regulation in mildly as well as severely dysplastic/in situ carcinoma cells and down-regulation in invasive carcinoma, especially in the poorly differentiated type. Adenovirus-mediated reintroduction of DUSP6/MKP-3 into cultured pancreatic cancer cells induced strong expression of recombinant DUSP6/MKP-3 and reduction of phosphorylated ERK in a dose-dependent manner based on the multiplicity of infection and resulted in suppression of cell growth. Moreover, analyses by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry revealed that the exogenous expression of DUSP6/MKP-3 induced apoptosis. These results show that DUSP6 exerts apparent tumor-suppressive effects in vitro and suggest that DUSP6 is a strong candidate tumor suppressor gene at 12q22 locus.},

  Abstractnote             = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate reference genes for expression studies of human adipose tissue. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Using 52 human adipose tissue expression profiles (HU95), 10 putative reference genes with the lowest variation in expression levels were selected for further studies. Expression stability of these 10 novel and 5 previously established reference genes was evaluated by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. For this purpose, 44 adipose tissue biopsies from 27 subjects were chosen to include a wide range of parameters such as sex, age, BMI, depot origin, biopsy procedure, and effects of nutrition. RESULTS: LRP10 was identified as the gene with the least variation in expression levels. The frequently used reference genes RPLP0, 18S rRNA, PPIA, ACTB, and GAPD were ranked as 4, 6, 7, 8, and 10, respectively. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that LRP10 is a better choice as reference for expression studies of human adipose tissue compared with the most frequently used reference genes.},

  Abstractnote             = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: High-throughput measurement of transcript intensities using Affymetrix type oligonucleotide microarrays has produced a massive quantity of data during the last decade. Different preprocessing techniques exist to convert the raw signal intensities measured by these chips into gene expression estimates. Although these techniques have been widely benchmarked in the context of differential gene expression analysis, there are only few examples where their performance has been assessed in respect to coexpression-based studies such as sample classification. RESULTS: In the present paper we benchmark the three most used normalization procedures (MAS5, RMA and GCRMA) in the context of inter-array correlation analysis, confirming and extending the finding that RMA and GCRMA consistently overestimate sample similarity upon normalization. We determine that median polish summarization is responsible for generating a large proportion of these over-similarity artifacts. Furthermore, we show that most affected probesets show also internal signal disagreement, and tend to be composed by individual probes hitting different gene transcripts. We finally provide a correction to the RMA GCRMA summarization procedure that massively reduces inter-array correlation artifacts, without affecting the detection of differentially expressed genes. CONCLUSIONS: We propose tRMA as a modification of RMA to normalize microarray experiments for correlation-based analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of two laminin receptors, the 67 kDa laminin receptor (LBP) precursor and the alpha6 integrin subunit, in effusions and solid tumors of patients diagnosed with serous ovarian carcinoma and to evaluate their predictive role. Eighty-eight effusions and one hundred sixteen primary forty-one) and metastatic seventy-five) ovarian carcinomas were evaluated for expression of the above-mentioned mRNAs using in situ hybridization (ISH). LBP protein expression was studied in 24 effusions and 43 solid tumors using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Alpha6 integrin subunit protein expression was studied in 27 effusions using flow cytometry (FCM). Expression of LBP mRNA was frequently detected in both carcinoma (92 of 116 cases, 79%) and stromal (79 of 116 cases, 68%) cells in solid tumors. Expression was still higher in cancer cells in effusions (85 of 88 specimens, 96%). In contrast, alpha6 integrin subunit was less frequently detected in both solid tumors (33 of 116; 28% in carcinoma cells, 23 of 116; 20% in stromal cells) and effusions (36 of 88; 41%). LBP protein expression was found in 19 of 24 (79%) effusions and 40 of 43 (93%) solid tumors, and was higher in effusions of patients who received chemotherapy prior to tapping (P = 0.024). FCM showed protein expression of the alpha6 integrin subunit in 17 of 27 (63%) effusions. Expression of the alpha6 integrin subunit mRNA in tumor cells of solid lesions was significantly lower in solid tumors of FIGO stage-IV patients compared to those of patients diagnosed with stage-III-disease (P = 0.004), and its absence predicted significantly shorter overall survival (OS) in univariate analysis (P = 0.018). Absence of alpha6 integrin subunit protein expression using FCM predicted median OS of 12 months compared to 26 months for patients with tumors expressing the protein, although this finding did not reach significance (P = 0.27). In conclusion, as opposed to previous reports, both mRNA and protein expression of the alpha6 integrin subunit do not appear to be down-regulated in effusions compared to solid tumors. Loss of alpha6 integrin subunit mRNA (and possibly protein) expression is a novel prognostic marker in advanced-stage ovarian carcinoma. LBP mRNA and protein expression is independent of that of the alpha6 integrin subunit in both solid tumors and effusions of serous ovarian carcinoma.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Ovarian carcinoma often is called the “silent killer” because the disease usually is not detected until an advanced stage. The authors? goal was to evaluate preoperative symptoms and factors that may contribute to delayed diagnosis for women with ovarian carcinoma. METHODS: A two-page survey was distributed to 1500 women who subscribe to CONVERSATIONS!, a newsletter about ovarian carcinoma. Because the survey could be copied and given to other patients, 1725 surveys were returned from women in 46 states and 4 Canadian provinces. RESULTS: The median age of the surveyed women was 52 years, and 70% had Stage III or IV disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics). When asked about symptoms before the diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma, 95% reported symptoms, which were categorized as abdominal (77%), gastrointestinal (70%), pain (58%), constitutional (50%), urinary (34%), and pelvic (26%). Only 11% of women with Stage I/II and 3% with Stage III/IV reported no symptoms before their diagnosis. Women who ignored their symptoms were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with advanced disease compared with those who did not (P = 0.002). The time required for a health care provider to make the diagnosis was reported as less than 3 months by 55%, but greater than 6 months by 26% and greater than 1 year by 11%. Factors significantly associated with delay in diagnosis were omission of a pelvic exam at first visit; having a multitude of symptoms; being diagnosed initially with no problem, depression, stress, irritable bowel, or gastritis; not initially receiving an ultrasound, computed tomography, or CA 125 test; and younger age. The type of health care provider seen initially, insurance, and specific symptoms did not correlate with delayed diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This large national survey confirms that the majority of women with ovarian carcinoma are symptomatic and frequently have delays in diagnosis.},

Here, a generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective Resection of primary colorectal cancer is associated with enhanced risk of development of liver metastases. It was previously demonstrated that surgery initiated an early inflammatory response resulting in elevated tumour cell adhesion in the liver. Because reactive oxygen species (ROS) are shown to be produced and released during surgery, the effects of ROS on the liver vascular lining and tumour cell adhesion were investigated. Methods Human endothelial cell monolayers (human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human microvascular endothelial cells of the lung (HMEC-1s)) were exposed to ROS production, after which electrical impedance, cellular integrity and tumour cell adhesion were investigated. Furthermore, surgery-induced tumour cell adhesion as well as the role of ROS and liver macrophages (Kupffer cells) in this process were studied in vivo. Results Production of ROS decreased cellular impedance of endothelial monolayers dramatically. Moreover, formation of intercellular gaps in endothelial monolayers was observed, exposing subendothelial extracellular matrix (ECM) on which colon carcinoma cells adhered via integrin molecules. Endothelial damage was, however, prevented in the presence of ROS-scavenging enzymes. Additionally, surgery induced downregulation of both rat and human liver tight junction molecules. Treatment of rats with the ROS scavenger edaravone prevented surgery-induced tumour cell adhesion and downregulation of tight junction proteins in the liver. Interestingly, depletion of Kupffer cells prior to surgery significantly reduced the numbers of adhered tumour cells and prevented disruption of expression of tight junction proteins. Conclusions In this study it is shown that surgery-induced ROS production by macrophages damages the vascular lining by downregulating tight junction proteins. This leads to exposure of ECM, to which circulating tumour cells bind. In light of this, perioperative therapeutic intervention, preventing surgery-induced inflammatory reactions, may reduce the risk of developing liver metastases, thereby improving the clinical outcome of patients with colorectal cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {A major challenge in biomedical studies in recent years has been the classification of gene expression profiles into categories, such as cases and controls. This is done by first training a classifier by using a labeled training set containing labeled samples from the two populations, and then using that classifier to predict the labels of new samples. Such predictions have recently been shown to improve the diagnosis and treatment selection practices for several diseases. This procedure is complicated, however, by the high dimensionality if the data. While microarrays can measure the levels of thousands of genes per sample, case-control microarray studies usually involve no more than several dozen samples. Standard classifiers do not work well in these situations where the number of features (gene expression levels measured in these microarrays) far exceeds the number of samples. Selecting only the features that are most relevant for discriminating between the two categories can help construct better classifiers, in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. In this work we developed a novel method for multivariate feature selection based on the Partial Least Squares algorithm. We compared the method's variants with common feature selection techniques across a large number of real case-control datasets, using several classifiers. We demonstrate the advantages of the method and the preferable combinations of classifier and feature selection technique.},

  Abstractnote             = {MOTIVATION: Gene selection algorithms for cancer classification, based on the expression of a small number of biomarker genes, have been the subject of considerable research in recent years. Shevade and Keerthi propose a gene selection algorithm based on sparse logistic regression (SLogReg) incorporating a Laplace prior to promote sparsity in the model parameters, and provide a simple but efficient training procedure. The degree of sparsity obtained is determined by the value of a regularization parameter, which must be carefully tuned in order to optimize performance. This normally involves a model selection stage, based on a computationally intensive search for the minimizer of the cross-validation error. In this paper, we demonstrate that a simple Bayesian approach can be taken to eliminate this regularization parameter entirely, by integrating it out analytically using an uninformative Jeffrey?s prior. The improved algorithm (BLogReg) is then typically two or three orders of magnitude faster than the original algorithm, as there is no longer a need for a model selection step. The BLogReg algorithm is also free from selection bias in performance estimation, a common pitfall in the application of machine learning algorithms in cancer classification. RESULTS: The SLogReg, BLogReg and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) gene selection algorithms are evaluated over the well-studied colon cancer and leukaemia benchmark datasets. The leave-one-out estimates of the probability of test error and cross-entropy of the BLogReg and SLogReg algorithms are very similar, however the BlogReg algorithm is found to be considerably faster than the original SLogReg algorithm. Using nested cross-validation to avoid selection bias, performance estimation for SLogReg on the leukaemia dataset takes almost 48 h, whereas the corresponding result for BLogReg is obtained in only 1 min 24 s, making BLogReg by far the more practical algorithm. BLogReg also demonstrates better estimates of conditional probability than the RVM, which are of great importance in medical applications, with similar computational expense. AVAILABILITY: A MATLAB implementation of the sparse logistic regression algorithm with Bayesian regularization (BLogReg) is available from http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~gcc/cbl/blogreg/},

  Abstractnote             = {Background: Several preprocessing algorithms for Affymetrix gene expression microarrays have been developed, and their performance on spike-in data sets has been evaluated previously. However, a comprehensive comparison of preprocessing algorithms on samples taken under research conditions has not been performed. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used TaqMan RT-PCR arrays as a reference to evaluate the accuracy of expression values from Affymetrix microarrays in two experimental data sets: one comprising 84 genes in 36 colon biopsies, and the other comprising 75 genes in 29 cancer cell lines. We evaluated consistency using the Pearson correlation between measurements obtained on the two platforms. Also, we introduce the log-ratio discrepancy as a more relevant measure of discordance between gene expression platforms. Of nine preprocessing algorithms tested, PLIER+16 produced expression values that were most consistent with RT-PCR measurements, although the difference in performance between most of the algorithms was not statistically significant. Conclusions/Significance: Our results support the choice of PLIER+16 for the preprocessing of clinical Affymetrix microarray data. However, other algorithms performed similarly and are probably also good choices.},

Genetic and molecular definition of these three immune hallmarks of cancer offers the opportunity to learn how to deploy specific countermeasures to reverse the situation in favor of the immune system and, eventually, the patient. This new information could be channeled to address what seem to be the three major hallmarks for the immune control of cancer progression: effective procedures to activate immune reactivity; characterization of not-disposable oncoantigens; and counteraction of immune suppression.},

  Abstract                 = {Oligonucleotide microarrays are an informative tool to elucidate gene regulatory networks. In order for gene expression levels to be comparable across microarrays, normalization procedures have to be invoked. A large number of methods have been described to correct for systematic biases in microarray experiments. The performance of these methods has been tested only to a limited extend. Here, we evaluate two different types of microarray analyses: (i) the same gene in replicate samples and (ii) different, but co-expressed genes in the same sample. The reliability of the latter analysis needs to be determined for the analysis of regulatory networks and our report is the first attempt to evaluate for the accuracy of different microarray normalization methods in this respect. Consistent with previous results we observed a large effect of the normalization method on the outcome of the expression analyses. Our analyses indicate that different normalization methods should be performed depending on whether a study is aiming to detect differential gene expression between independent samples or whether co-expressed genes should be identified. We make recommendations about the most appropriate method to use.},

  Abstractnote             = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book?s coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for wide data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

1.1 Introduction

The analysis of DNA copy number changes throughout the whole genome started with

the introduction of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), first described in 1992 by

Kallioniemi et al. [1]. This elegant technique was based on the competitive hybridization

of two pools of fluorescent-labeled probes, one made up of whole-genome DNA of a test

and another of a control sample, to a metaphase preparation of normal chromosomes. Along

each chromosome, the fluorescent intensity of the test DNA was quantified and compared

with the control intensity, resulting in ‘relative copy number karyotypes.’


It appeared to be very difficult to reproduce the method in laboratories not specialized

in chromosome techniques. Only after the publication of an article reviewing all steps

in great detail did CGH become more widely applied [2], especially in cancer genetics.

The possibility of using DNA obtained from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE)

samples opened up the way for retrospective studies of tumors with clinical follow-up data,

enabling the identification of genetic changes related to tumor progression, invasion and

metastasis [3].

How Oxygen, Electrochemical Toxic, and Metal Oxide 

Semiconductor Sensors Work * 

1. Oxygen sensor detection principle 

Most portable or survey instruments used for workplace evaluation of oxygen concentrations make use of "fuel 

cell" type oxygen sensors. "Fuel cell" oxygen sensors consist of a diffusion barrier, a sensing electrode (cathode) 

made of a noble metal such as gold or platinum, and a working electrode made of a base metal such as lead or 

zinc immersed in a basic electrolyte (such as a solution of potassium hydroxide). Oxygen diffusing into the 

sensor is reduced to hydroxyl ions at the cathode: 


O2 + 2H2O + 4e- ? OH - 

Hydroxyl ions in turn oxidize the lead (or zinc) anode: 


2Pb + 4OH ? 2PbO + 2H2O + 4e- 

This yields an overall cell reaction of: 


2Pb + O2 ? 2PbO 

Fuel cell oxygen sensors are current generators. The amount of current generated is proportional to the amount 

of oxygen consumed (Faraday's Law). Oxygen reading instruments simply monitor the current output of the 

sensor. 


An important consideration is that fuel cell oxygen sensors are used up over time. In the cell reaction above, when 

all available surface area of the lead (Pb) anode has been converted to lead oxide (PbO), electrochemical activity 

ceases, current output falls to zero, and the sensor must be rebuilt or replaced. Fuel cell sensors are designed to 

last no more than one to two years. Even when installed in an instrument which is never turned on, oxygen 

sensors which are exposed to atmosphere which contains oxygen are generating current, and being used up. 


Oxygen sensors are also influenced by the temperature of the atmosphere they are being used to measure. A 

warmer atmosphere leads to faster electrochemical reactions. For this reason oxygen sensors usually include a 

temperature compensating load resistor to hold current output steady in the face of fluctuating temperature. 

(Microprocessor based instrument designs usually provide additional signal correction in software to further 

improve accuracy.) Another limiting factor is cold. The freezing temperature of electrolyte mixtures commonly 

used in oxygen sensors tends to be about 5F (- 20C). Once the electrolyte has frozen solid, electrical output falls 

to zero, and readings may no longer be obtained. There are two basic variations on the fuel cell oxygen sensor 

design. These variations have to do with the mechanism by which oxygen is allowed to diffuse into the sensor. 

Dalton's Law states that the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial 

pressures of the various gases. The partial pressure for oxygen is that fraction of the total pressure due to 

oxygen. Partial atmospheric pressure oxygen sensors rely on the partial pressure (or pO 2) of oxygen to drive 

molecules through the diffusion barrier into the sensor. As long as the pO 2 remains constant, current output may 

be used to indicate oxygen concentration. On the other hand, shifts in barometric pressure, altitude, or other 

conditions which have an effect on atmospheric pressure will have a strong effect on pO 2 sensor readings. To 

illustrate the effects of pressure on pO 2 sensors, consider a sensor located at sea level where atmospheric 

pressure equals 14.7 PSI (pounds per square inch). Now consider that same sensor at an elevation of 10,000 

feet. Although at both elevations the air contains 20.9 percent oxygen, at 10,000 feet the atmospheric pressure is 

only 10.2 PSI! Since there is less force driving oxygen molecules through the diffusion barrier into the sensor, the 

current output is significantly lower. 


"Capillary pore" oxygen sensor designs include a narrow diameter tube through which oxygen diffuses into the 

sensor. Oxygen is drawn into the sensor by capillary action in much the same way that water or fluid is drawn up 

into the fibers of a paper towel. While capillary pore sensors are not influenced by changes in pressure, care must 

be taken that the sensor design includes a moisture barrier in order to prevent the pore from being plugged with 

water or other fluids. },

  Abstract                 = {Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is clinically heterogeneous. Apart from an association with ionizing radiation, the etiology and molecular biology of PTC is poorly understood. We used oligo-based DNA arrays to study the expression profiles of eight matched pairs of normal thyroid and PTC tissues. Additional PTC tumors and other tissues were studied by reverse transcriptasePCR and immunohistochemistry. The PTCs showed concordant expression of many genes and distinct clustered profiles. Genes with increased expression in PTC included many encoding adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins. Expression was increased in 8/8 tumors for 24 genes and in 7/8 tumors for 22 genes. Among these genes were several previously known to be overexpressed in PTC, such as MET, LGALS3, KRT19, DPP4, MDK, TIMP1, and FN1. The numerous additional genes include CITED1, CHI3L1, ODZ1, N33, SFTPB, and SCEL. Reverse transcriptasePCR showed high expression of CITED1, CHI3L1, ODZ1, and SCEL in 6/6 additional PTCs. Immunohistochemical analysis detected CITED1 and SFTPB in 49/52 and 39/52 PTCs, respectively, but not in follicular thyroid carcinoma and normal thyroid tissue. Genes underexpressed in PTC included tumor suppressors, thyroid function-related proteins, and fatty acid binding proteins. Expression was decreased in 7/8 tumors for eight genes and decreased in 6/8 tumors for 19 genes. We conclude that, despite its clinical heterogeneity, PTC is characterized by consistent and specific molecular changes. These findings reveal clues to the molecular pathways involved in PTC and may provide biomarkers for clinical use.},

One important use of such databases is the ability to search for experiments that have similar gene expression levels as a query, potentially identifying previously unsuspected relationships among cellular states. Such searches depend crucially on the metric used to assess the similarity between pairs of experiments. The complex joint distribution of gene expression levels, particularly their correlational structure and non-normality, make simple similarity metrics such as Euclidean distance or correlational similarity scores suboptimal for use in this application. We present a similarity metric for gene expression array experiments that takes into account the complex joint distribution of expression values. We provide a computationally tractable approximation to this measure, and have implemented a database search tool based on it. We discuss implementation issues and efficiency, and we compare our new metric to other standard metrics.},

It has been shown that cytoplasmic RNA oxidation occurs to a great extent in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. The goal of

this study was to isolate and identify oxidized RNA species in AD. We show that significant amounts of poly(A) mRNAs are oxidized in

AD brains. RNA oxidation is not random but highly selective. Importantly, many identified oxidized mRNA species have been implicated

in the pathogenesis of AD. Quantitative analysis revealed that some mRNA species are more susceptible to oxidative damage. We also

investigated the biological consequence of oxidatively damaged mRNAs by expressing them in cell lines. Our data indicated that abnor-

mal processing of proteins occurred to the oxidized mRNAs. This may implicate the potential contribution of RNA oxidation in the

pathogenesis of AD.

By taking advantage of a sequence of data reducing linear transformations (consistent with the computation of ordinary PLS-DA components), PPLS-DA computes each component from the transformed data by maximization of a parameterized Rayleigh quotient associated with FCDA. Models found by the powered PLS methodology can contribute to reveal the relevance of particular predictors and often requires fewer and simpler components than their ordinary PLS counterparts. From the possibility of imposing restrictions on the powers available for optimization we obtain an explorative approach to predictive modeling not available to the traditional PLS methods.

Using two extensive spike-in studies and a dilution study, we developed a set of tools for assessing the effectiveness of expression measures. We found that the performance of the current version of the default expression measure provided by Affymetrix Microarray Suite can be significantly improved by the use of probe level summaries derived from empirically motivated statistical models.

  Abstractnote             = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth?s Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

Various studies have been published comparing competing platforms with mixed results: some find agreement, others do not. As the number of researchers starting to use microarrays and the number of cross-platform meta-analysis studies rapidly increases, appropriate platform assessments become more important. Here we present results from a comparison study that offers important improvements over those previously described in the literature. In particular, we noticed that none of the previously published papers consider differences between labs. For this study, a consortium of ten laboratories from the Washington, DC-Baltimore, USA, area was formed to compare data obtained from three widely used platforms using identical RNA samples. We used appropriate statistical analysis to demonstrate that there are relatively large differences in data obtained in labs using the same platform, but that the results from the best-performing labs agree rather well.},

  Abstractnote             = {MOTIVATION: In the Affymetrix GeneChip system, preprocessing occurs before one obtains expression level measurements. Because the number of competing preprocessing methods was large and growing we developed a benchmark to help users identify the best method for their application. A webtool was made available for developers to benchmark their procedures. At the time of writing over 50 methods had been submitted. RESULTS: We benchmarked 31 probe set algorithms using a U95A dataset of spike in controls. Using this dataset, we found that background correction, one of the main steps in preprocessing, has the largest effect on performance. In particular, background correction appears to improve accuracy but, in general, worsen precision. The benchmark results put this balance in perspective. Furthermore, we have improved some of the original benchmark metrics to provide more detailed information regarding precision and accuracy. A handful of methods stand out as providing the best balance using spike-in data with the older U95A array, although different experiments on more current arrays may benchmark differently.

Their expression varied considerably in different tissue samples analyzed. The expression of UBQ5 and eEF-1alpha was most stable across all the tissue samples examined. However, 18S and 25S rRNA exhibited most stable expression in plants grown under various environmental conditions. Also, a set of two genes was found to be better as control for normalization of the data.

  Abstract                 = {The proglucagon gene (gcg) encodes a number of peptide hormones that are of cell-type specifically expressed in the pancreatic islets, the distal ileum and the large intestine, as well as certain brain neuronal cells. These hormones are important in controlling blood glucose homeostasis, intestinal cell proliferation, and satiety. More importantly, the major hormone generated in the pancreas (i.e. glucagon) exerts opposite effects to the ones that are produced in the intestines (i.e. glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GLP-2). To understand the mechanisms underlying cell-type-specific gcg expression may lead to the identification of novel drug targets to control endogenous hormone production for therapeutic purposes. Extensive in vitro examinations have shown that more than a half dozen of homeodomain (HD) proteins are able to interact with the gcg gene promoter and activate its expression. In vivo “knock-out” mouse studies, however, cannot demonstrate the role of some of them (i.e. Cdx-2, Brn-4, and Nkx6.2) in the development of pancreatic islet alpha-cells, suggesting that these HD proteins may exert some redundant functions in the genesis of gcg-producing cells. Investigations have also revealed that gcg expression is controlled by both protein kinase A and Epac signaling pathways in response to cAMP elevation, and cell-type specifically controlled by insulin and the effectors of the Wnt signaling pathway. This review summarizes our current understanding on the mechanisms underlying gcg transcription and presented my interpretations on how the interactions between different signaling networks regulate gcg expression.},

PLS has major advantages for analyzing microarray data since it can model data sets with large numbers of variables and with few observations. A response model was derived describing the expression profile over time expected for periodically transcribed genes, and was used to identify budding yeast transcripts with similar profiles. PLS was then used to interpret the importance of the variables (genes) for the model, yielding a ranking list of how well the genes fitted the generated model. Application of an appropriate cutoff value, calculated from randomized data, allows the identification of genes whose expression appears to be synchronized with cell cycling. Our approach also provides information about the stage in the cell cycle where their transcription peaks. Three synchronized yeast cell microarray data sets were analyzed, both separately and combined. Cell cycle-coupled periodicity was suggested for 455 of the 6,178 transcripts monitored in the combined data set, at a significance level of 0.5%. Among the candidates, 85% of the known periodic transcripts were included. Analysis of the three data sets separately yielded similar ranking lists, showing that the method is robust.},

  Abstractnote             = {A method, canonical PLS, is proposed for performing the basic PLS calculations in the canonical co-ordinate system of the predictor matrix X. This reduces the size of the problem to its smallest possible dimension as determined by the rank of X. The computation is further simplified since the cross-product matrices XTX and XXT are symmetric. PLS weights, scores and loadings referring to the canonical co-ordinate system can be easily back-transformed to the original co-ordinate system. The method offers an ideal setting to carry out the continuum regression approach to PLS introduced by Wise and Ricker. By raising the singular values to some power gamma, one may artificially decrease (gamma &lt; 1) or increase (gamma &gt; 1) the degree of multicollinearity in the X data. One may investigate a series of models by considering various values of the power gamma. This offers a means to push the model into the direction of ordinary least squares (gamma = 0) or principal components regression (gammararrinfin), with PLS regression as an intermediate case (gamma = 1). Since all these computations are mainly performed in canonical space, obtained after one singular value decomposition, a considerable gain in speed is achieved. This is demonstrated over a wide range of data set sizes (number of X and Y variables, number of samples) and model parameters (number of latent variables and number of powers considered). The gains in computational efficiency (as measured by the ratio of the number of floating point operations required relative to the original algorithm) range from a factor of 39 to over 100.

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: Significance analysis of differential expression in DNA microarray data is an important task. Much of the current research is focused on developing improved tests and software tools. The task is difficult not only owing to the high dimensionality of the data (number of genes), but also because of the often non-negligible presence of missing values. There is thus a great need to reliably impute these missing values prior to the statistical analyses. Many imputation methods have been developed for DNA microarray data, but their impact on statistical analyses has not been well studied. In this work we examine how missing values and their imputation affect significance analysis of differential expression. RESULTS: We develop a new imputation method (LinCmb) that is superior to the widely used methods in terms of normalized root mean squared error. Its estimates are the convex combinations of the estimates of existing methods. We find that LinCmb adapts to the structure of the data: If the data are heterogeneous or if there are few missing values, LinCmb puts more weight on local imputation methods; if the data are homogeneous or if there are many missing values, LinCmb puts more weight on global imputation methods. Thus, LinCmb is a useful tool to understand the merits of different imputation methods. We also demonstrate that missing values affect significance analysis. Two datasets, different amounts of missing values, different imputation methods, the standard t-test and the regularized t-test and ANOVA are employed in the simulations. We conclude that good imputation alleviates the impact of missing values and should be an integral part of microarray data analysis. The most competitive methods are LinCmb, GMC and BPCA. Popular imputation schemes such as SVD, row mean, and KNN all exhibit high variance and poor performance. The regularized t-test is less affected by missing values than the standard t-test.

  Abstractnote             = {BACKGROUND: There is a certain difference in opinion regarding the optimal choice of housekeeping genes used as normalization factors in gene expression analysis. We have therefore examined the suitability of three housekeeping genes, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase, beta-glucuronidase and beta2-micro-globulin, for normalization of expression data from melanoma metastases. METHODS: The expression of the three housekeeping genes was quantified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR in snap-frozen sections from 44 melanoma metastases, of which 19 were from patients treated with cisplatinum, dacarbazine and interferon-alpha2b. RESULTS: The expression of each housekeeping gene varied considerably between the different metastases. Histopathological examination of the tissue sections revealed variation in the amount of tumor cells in the tissue, necrosis, varying degrees of lymphocyte infiltration, and lymph node remnants. Based on this examination, 16 biopsies were omitted from further analysis because they had cracked, contained empty or necrotic areas, or were dominated by lymph node tissue. Even in sections with more than 90% tumor cells, a wide variation in the expression of the three housekeeping genes was found. The amount of lymphatic infiltrate in the tumors can have an effect on the expression of housekeeping genes in the metastases, whereas treatment did not seem to influence the expression. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the choice of housekeeping genes can have great impact on the normalization of specific genes in melanoma metastases. Furthermore, in the analysis of mRNA expression in tumor tissue, microscopic examination is of great importance to evaluate the integrity and cellular composition of the biopsy.},

The TPO preparation was characterized kinetically and controlled by Western-blotting technique. The chemiluminescence method proved to be reproducible and much more sensitive than the widely used guaiacol method, being able to detect TPO concentrations of 2.21 x 10(-5) g/L vs 6.63 x 10(-2) g/L with the latter. Otherwise, the determinations with the two methods correlated well (r = 0.76). Investigating the effect of IgGs from 23 hypothyroid patients on measured TPO activity, we detected inhibition in 19 cases with the chemiluminescence technique (15 with the guaiacol method). Anti-TPO antibodies showed competitive inhibition of TPO activity with respect to the substrate guaiacol. In both systems, the inhibition is present in the IgG F(ab?)2 fragment. We conclude that the high sensitivity of chemiluminescence detection allows routine determination of the inhibition of TPO activity by anti-TPO antibodies.},

  Abstractnote             = {Background: PCR has the potential to detect and precisely quantify specific DNA sequences, but it is not yet often used as a fully quantitative method. A number of data collection and processing strategies have been described for the implementation of quantitative PCR. However, they can be experimentally cumbersome, their relative performances have not been evaluated systematically, and they often remain poorly validated statistically and/or experimentally. In this study, we evaluated the performance of known methods, and compared them with newly developed data processing strategies in terms of resolution, precision and robustness. Results: Our results indicate that simple methods that do not rely on the estimation of the efficiency of the PCR amplification may provide reproducible and sensitive data, but that they do not quantify DNA with precision. Other evaluated methods based on sigmoidal or exponential curve fitting were generally of both poor resolution and precision. A statistical analysis of the parameters that influence efficiency indicated that it depends mostly on the selected amplicon and to a lesser extent on the particular biological sample analyzed. Thus, we devised various strategies based on individual or averaged efficiency values, which were used to assess the regulated expression of several genes in response to a growth factor. Conclusion: Overall, qPCR data analysis methods differ significantly in their performance, and this analysis identifies methods that provide DNA quantification estimates of high precision, robustness and reliability. These methods allow reliable estimations of relative expression ratio of two-fold or higher, and our analysis provides an estimation of the number of biological samples that have to be analyzed to achieve a given precision.},

  Abstract                 = {The level of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in serum reflects the replicative activity of HBV. To compare serum HBV DNA levels in different states of hepatitis B, 47 sera of patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, 4 sera of patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B, 40 samples of patients after HBeAg seroconversion during alpha interferon treatment, 57 sera of inactive HBsAg carriers, and 42 sera of patients who had recovered from chronic hepatitis B more than 12 months prior to blood collection were checked for the presence of HBV DNA with the Amplicor HBV Monitor Test. In patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B, the median of serum HBV DNA levels (8.3 x 10(8) copies/ml) was significantly higher than that for patients after HBeAg seroconversion (6.2 x 10(3) copies/ml) and than that for inactive HBsAg carriers (5.6 x 10(3) copies/ml). None of the patients who had recovered from hepatitis B had detectable HBV DNA in serum. Quantitative PCR proved to be a valuable tool for identification of different states of HBV infection. This technique was found to be a good method for determination of serum HBV DNA levels both for patients with HBeAg seroconversion and for inactive carriers who showed low viremia not detectable by conventional hybridization assays.},

  Abstractnote             = {Many tasks (e.g., search and summarization) result in an ordered list of items. In order to evaluate such an ordered list of items, we need to compare it with an ideal ordered list created by a human expert for the same set of items. To reduce any bias, multiple human experts are often used to create multiple ideal ordered lists. An interesting challenge in such an evaluation method is thus how to aggregate these different ideal lists to compute a single score for an ordered list to be evaluated. In this paper, we propose three new methods for aggregating multiple order judgments to evaluate ordered lists: weighted correlation aggregation, rank-based aggregation, and frequent sequential pattern-based aggregation. Experiment results on ordering sentences for text summarization show that all the three new methods outperform the state of the art average correlation methods in terms of discriminativeness and robustness against noise. Among the three proposed methods, the frequent sequential pattern-based method performs the best due to the flexible modeling of agreements and disagreements among human experts at various levels of granularity.},

The BRAF V600E mutation has been identified as the most common genetic abnormality in PTC. Moreover, it is known to be more prevalent in Korean PTC patients than in patients from other countries.

  Abstractnote             = {Experiments using quantitative real-time PCR to test hypotheses are limited by technical and biological variability; we seek to minimise sources of confounding variability through optimum use of biological and technical replicates. The quality of an experiment design is commonly assessed by calculating its prospective power. Such calculations rely on knowledge of the expected variances of the measurements of each group of samples and the magnitude of the treatment effect; the estimation of which is often uninformed and unreliable. Here we introduce a method that exploits a small pilot study to estimate the biological and technical variances in order to improve the design of a subsequent large experiment. We measure the variance contributions at several “levels” of the experiment design and provide a means of using this information to predict both the total variance and the prospective power of the assay. A validation of the method is provided through a variance analysis of representative genes in several bovine tissue-types. We also discuss the effect of normalisation to a reference gene in terms of the measured variance components of the gene of interest. Finally, we describe a software implementation of these methods, powerNest, that gives the user the opportunity to input data from a pilot study and interactively modify the design of the assay. The software automatically calculates expected variances, statistical power, and optimal design of the larger experiment. powerNest enables the researcher to minimise the total confounding variance and maximise prospective power for a specified maximum cost for the large study.},

  Abstract                 = {Colorectal cancer is a serious medical and economic problem in Poland, as the detection and results of its treatment are very low. Due to this fact, medical research is still conducted in order to find out the symptoms of this tumor and proper preventive measures. According to one hypothesis of carcinogenesis, the process of creating the tumor begins and develops when the balance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their deactivation by the “antioxidant protective barrier of the organism” is disturbed. As a result of this theory, it has been decided to examine the plasma concentration of the dietary minerals which work as antioxidants. The results entailed conclusions which prove the free radicals theory of carcinogenesis. They also confirm the part which the antioxidant protective barrier plays in the defence against ROS and their carcinogenic consequences.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract 10.1002/aic.690370209.abs Nonlinear principal component analysis is a novel technique for multivariate data analysis, similar to the well-known method of principal component analysis. NLPCA, like PCA, is used to identify and remove correlations among problem variables as an aid to dimensionality reduction, visualization, and exploratory data analysis. While PCA identifies only linear correlations between variables, NLPCA uncovers both linear and nonlinear correlations, without restriction on the character of the nonlinearities present in the data. NLPCA operates by training a feedforward neural network to perform the identity mapping, where the network inputs are reproduced at the output layer. The network contains an internal ” bottleneck” layer (containing fewer nodes than input or output layers), which forces the network to develop a compact representation of the input data, and two additional hidden layers. The NLPCA method is demonstrated using time-dependent, simulated batch reaction data. Results show that NLPCA successfully reduces dimensionality and produces a feature space map resembling the actual distribution of the underlying system parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {Although the appearance of follicular thyroid tumors in the population is high, only a small part of them are malignant. Follicular tumors are built of follicular epithelial cells and are encapsulated. Cell atypia differentiates follicular adenoma from cancer. Follicular cancer is characterized by vascular invasion and causes metastases through blood vessels, mainly to lungs and bones. In the diagnosis of follicular thyroid neoplasm, pathological examination of postoperative material plays a leading role. In diagnosis before surgical treatment, physical examination, ultrasound (USG), and fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) are of great importance. The choice of treatment in patients in which follicular neoplasm has been diagnosed by FNAB awakes controversies. In practice it is impossible to determine reliably before surgery whether the lesion is malignant or not. Because of the rare incidence of thyroid cancer in the general population, more and more authors tend to decide on partial resection of the thyroid gland and possible radicalization if cancer is diagnosed on paraffin specimen examination.},

  Abstractnote             = {The use of Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis for the sake of model selection and threshold optimisation has become a standard practice for the design of two-class pattern recognition systems. Advantages include decision boundary adaptation to imbalanced misallocation costs, the ability to fix some classification errors, and performance evaluation in imprecise, ill-defined conditions where costs, or prior probabilities may vary. Extending this to the multiclass case has recently become a topic of interest. The primary challenge involved is the computational complexity, that increases to the power of the number of classes, rendering many problems intractable. In this paper the multiclass ROC is formalised, and the computational complexities exposed. A pairwise approach is proposed that approximates the multidimensional operating characteristic by discounting some interactions, resulting in an algorithm that is tractable, and extensible to large numbers of classes. Two additional multiclass optimisation techniques are also proposed that provide a benchmark for the pairwise algorithm. Experiments compare the various approaches in a variety of practical situations, demonstrating the efficacy of the pairwise approach. 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Finally, the analysis of the results obtained on several real data sets allows to find a rationale for a sensible application, showing that, if correctly applied, this technique almost always produces very good results.},

  Abstract                 = {TSG-6 cDNA was isolated by differential screening of a lambda cDNA library prepared from tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-treated human diploid FS-4 fibroblasts. We show that TSG-6 mRNA was not detectable in untreated cells, but became readily induced by TNF in normal human fibroblast lines and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In contrast, TSG-6 mRNA was undetectable in either control or TNF-treated human vascular endothelial cells and a variety of tumor-derived or virus-transformed cell lines. The sequence of full-length TSG-6 cDNA revealed one major open reading frame predicting a polypeptide of 277 amino acids, including a typical cleavable signal peptide. The NH2- terminal half of the predicted TSG-6 protein sequence shows a significant homology with a region implicated in hyaluronate binding, present in cartilage link protein, proteoglycan core proteins, and the adhesion receptor CD44. The most extensive sequence homology exists between the predicted TSG-6 protein and CD44. Western blot analysis with an antiserum raised against a TSG-6 fusion protein detected a 39- kD glycoprotein in the supernatants of TNF-treated FS-4 cells and of cells transfected with TSG-6 cDNA. Binding of the TSG-6 protein to hyaluronate was demonstrated by coprecipitation. Our data indicate that the inflammatory cytokine (TNF or IL-1)-inducible, secretory TSG-6 protein is a novel member of the family of hyaluronate binding proteins, possibly involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions during inflammation and tumorigenesis.},

This becomes a major problem when batch effects are correlated with an outcome of interest and lead to incorrect conclusions. Using both published studies and our own analyses, we argue that batch effects (as well as other technical and biological artefacts) are widespread and critical to address.

  Abstractnote             = {Background: A model-based analysis of oligonucleotide expression arrays we developed previously uses a probe-sensitivity index to capture the response characteristic of a specific probe pair and calculates model-based expression indexes (MBEI). MBEI has standard error attached to it as a measure of accuracy. Here we investigate the stability of the probe-sensitivity index across different tissue types, the reproducibility of results in replicate experiments, and the use of MBEI in perfect match (PM)-only arrays. Results: Probe-sensitivity indexes are stable across tissue types. The target gene?s presence in many arrays of an array set allows the probe-sensitivity index to be estimated accurately. We extended the model to obtain expression values for PM-only arrays, and found that the 20-probe PM-only model is comparable to the 10-probe PM/MM difference model, in terms of the expression correlations with the original 20-probe PM/MM difference model. MBEI method is able to extend the reliable detection limit of expression to a lower mRNA concentration. The standard errors of MBEI can be used to construct confidence intervals of fold changes, and the lower confidence bound of fold change is a better ranking statistic for filtering genes. We can assign reliability indexes for genes in a specific cluster of interest in hierarchical clustering by resampling clustering trees. A software dChip implementing many of these analysis methods is made available. Conclusions: The model-based approach reduces the variability of low expression estimates, and provides a natural method of calculating expression values for PM-only arrays. The standard errors attached to expression values can be used to assess the reliability of downstream analysis.},

The analysis of such experiments is nontrivial because of large data size and many levels of variation introduced at different stages of the experiments. The analysis is further complicated by the large differences that may exist among different probes used to interrogate the same gene. However, an attractive feature of high-density oligonucleotide arrays such as those produced by photolithography and inkjet technology is the standardization of chip manufacturing and hybridization process. As a result, probe-specific biases, although significant, are highly reproducible and predictable, and their adverse effect can be reduced by proper modeling and analysis methods. Here, we propose a statistical model for the probe-level data, and develop model-based estimates for gene expression indexes. We also present model-based methods for identifying and handling cross-hybridizing probes and contaminating array regions. Applications of these results will be presented elsewhere.},

Principle component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) are two frequently used feature extraction methods, and in the previous works, the top several components of PCA or PLS are selected for modeling according to the descending order of eigenvalues. While in this paper, we prove that not all the top features are useful, but features should be selected from all the components by feature selection methods. Results: We demonstrate a framework for selecting feature subsets from all the newly extracted components, leading to reduced classification error rates on the gene expression microarray data. Here we have considered both an unsupervised method PCA and a supervised method PLS for extracting new components, genetic algorithms for feature selection, and support vector machines and k nearest neighbor for classification. Experimental results illustrate that our proposed framework is effective to select feature subsets and to reduce classification error rates. Conclusion: Not only the top features newly extracted by PCA or PLS are important, therefore, feature selection should be performed to select subsets from new features to improve generalization performance of classifiers.},

The accuracy can be dependent on the mathematical model on which the quantitative methods are based. The generally accepted mathematical model assumes that amplification efficiencies are equal at the exponential phase of the reactions for the same amplicon. However, no methods are available to test the assumptions regarding amplification efficiency before one starts the real time PCR quantitation. Here we further develop and test the validity of a new mathematical model which dynamically fits real time PCR data with good correlation (R(2)=0.9995+/-0.002, n=50). The method is capable of measuring cycle-by-cycle PCR amplification efficiencies and demonstrates that these change dynamically. Validation of the method revealed the intrinsic relationship between the initial amount of gene transcript and kinetic parameters. A new quantitative method is proposed which represents a simple but accurate quantitative method.},

Shortfalls in the original Affymetrix probe annotation have been described; however, few studies have provided rigorous solutions for routine data analysis. Results: Using AceView, a comprehensive human transcript database, we have reannotated the probes by matching them to RNA transcripts instead of genes. Based on this transcript-level annotation, a new probe set definition was created in which every probe in a probe set maps to a common set of AceView gene transcripts. In addition, using artificial data sets we identified that a minimal probe set size of 4 is necessary for reliable statistical summarization. We further demonstrate that applying the new probe set definition can detect specific transcript variants contributing to differential expression and it also improves cross-platform concordance. Conclusion: We conclude that our transcript-level reannotation and redefinition of probe sets complement the original Affymetrix design. Redefinitions introduce probe sets whose sizes may not support reliable statistical summarization; therefore, we advocate using our transcript-level mapping redefinition in a secondary analysis step rather than as a replacement. Knowing which specific transcripts are differentially expressed is important to properly design probe/primer pairs for validation purposes. For convenience, we have created custom chip-description-files (CDFs) and annotation files for our new probe set definitions that are compatible with Bioconductor, Affymetrix Expression Console or third party software.},

  Abstract                 = {Motivation: Systematic information integration of multiple-related microarray studies has become an important issue as the technology becomes mature and prevalent in the past decade. The aggregated information provides more robust and accurate biomarker detection. So far, published meta-analysis methods for this purpose mostly consider two-class comparison. Methods for combining multi-class studies and considering expression pattern concordance are rarely explored.Results: In this article, we develop three integration methods for biomarker detection in multiple multi-class microarray studies: ANOVA-maxP, min-MCC and OW-min-MCC. We first consider a natural extension of combining P-values from the traditional ANOVA model. Since P-values from ANOVA do not guarantee to reflect the concordant expression pattern information across studies, we propose a multi-class correlation (MCC) measure to specifically seek for biomarkers of concordant inter-class patterns across a pair of studies. For both ANOVA and MCC approaches, we use extreme order statistics to identify biomarkers differentially expressed (DE) in all studies (i.e. ANOVA-maxP and min-MCC). The min-MCC method is further extended to identify biomarkers DE in partial studies by incorporating a recently developed optimally weighted (OW) technique (OW-min-MCC). All methods are evaluated by simulation studies and by three meta-analysis applications to multi-tissue mouse metabolism datasets, multi-condition mouse trauma datasets and multi-malignant-condition human prostate cancer datasets. The results show complementary strength of the three methods for different biological purposes.Availability: http://www.biostat.pitt.edu/bioinfo/Contact: ctseng@pitt.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data is available at Bioinformatics online.},

Typically, a feature subset selected by a feature selection method is evaluated for relevance towards a task such as prediction or classification. Another important property of a feature selection method is stability that refers to robustness of the selected features to perturbations in the data. In biomarker discovery, for example, domain experts prefer a parsimonious subset of features that are relatively robust to slight changes in the data. We present a stability measure called the adjusted stability measure that computes robustness of a feature selection method with respect to random feature selection. This measure is useful for comparing the robustness of feature selection methods and is superior to similar measures that do not account for random feature selection. We demonstrate the application of this measure on a biomedical dataset.},

  Abstract                 = {Relaxin is a polypeptide hormone produced in the human female by the corpus luteum of pregnancy and the decidua. In the male it is produced in the prostate and is present in human semen. It probably plays a paracrine role in the human and thus peripheral serum levels may not always reflect its activity. Although a large amount of pelvic relaxation is necessary in some species, such as rodents, for successful parturition, little increased joint mobility is necessary at human parturition. However, some women experience much greater degrees of pelvic girdle relaxation on average and this appears to be more common in the Scandinavian countries than the rest of the world. Studies are presented showing an association between high serum relaxin levels and symptom giving pelvic girdle relaxation during pregnancy. It is not yet possible to measure relaxin receptors in these women but high levels of relaxin or a susceptibility to relaxin may be contributing to this problem. Before considering manipulating relaxin levels or down grading relaxin receptors to try to improve the symptoms of pelvic girdle relaxation it is important to understand the many other roles of relaxin in the human. Evidence is presented that suggests that relaxin may have significant roles in sperm motility, fertilisation, implantation, uterine growth and accommodation, the control of myometrial activity to prevent preterm labour, cervical ripening and the facilitation of labour. The management of pelvic girdle relaxation is discussed.},

Recently, several protocols for real-time relative RT-PCR using the reporter dye SYBR Green I have appeared in the literature. In these methods, sample and control mRNA abundance is quantified relative to an internal reference RNA whose abundance is known not to change under the differing experimental conditions.We have developed new data analysis procedures for the two most promising of these methodologies and generated data appropriate to assess both the accuracy and precision of the two protocols. We demonstrate that while both methods produce results that are precise when 18S rRNA is used as an internal reference, only one of these methods produces consistently accurate results. We have used this latter system to show that mRNA abundances can be accurately measured and strongly correlate with cell surface protein and carbohydrate expression as assessed by flow cytometry under different conditions of B cell activation.},

  Abstract                 = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is often curable and preventable using current screening modalities. Unfortunately, screening compliance remains low, partly due to patient dissatisfaction with faecal/endoscopic testing. Recent guidelines advise CRC screening should begin with risk stratification. A blood-based test providing clinically actionable CRC risk information would likely improve screening compliance and enhance clinical decision making. We analyzed 196 gene expression profiles to select candidate CRC biomarkers. qRT-PCR was performed on 642 samples to develop a 7-gene biomarker panel using 112 CRC/120 controls (training set) and 202 CRC/208 controls (independent, blind test set). Panel performance characteristics and disease prevalence (0.7%) were then used to develop a scale assessing an individual?s current risk of having CRC based on his/her gene signature. A 7-gene panel (ANXA3, CLEC4D, LMNB1, PRRG4, TNFAIP6, VNN1 and IL2RB) discriminated CRC in the training set (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (ROC AUC), 0.80; accuracy, 73%; sensitivity, 82%; specificity 64%). The independent blind test set confirmed performance (ROC AUC, 0.80; accuracy, 71%; sensitivity, 72%; specificity, 70%). Individual gene profiles were compared against the population results and used to calculate the current relative risk for CRC. We have developed a 7-gene, blood-based biomarker panel that can stratify subjects according to their current relative risk across a broad range in an average-risk population. Across the continuous spectrum of risk as defined by the current relative risk scale, it is possible to identify clinically meaningful reference points that can assist patients and physicians in CRC screening decision making.},

  Abstractnote             = {Robust multiarray analysis (RMA) is the most widely used preprocessing algorithm for Affymetrix and Nimblegen gene expression microarrays. RMA performs background correction, normalization, and summarization in a modular way. The last 2 steps require multiple arrays to be analyzed simultaneously. The ability to borrow information across samples provides RMA various advantages. For example, the summarization step fits a parametric model that accounts for probe effects, assumed to be fixed across arrays, and improves outlier detection. Residuals, obtained from the fitted model, permit the creation of useful quality metrics. However, the dependence on multiple arrays has 2 drawbacks: (1) RMA cannot be used in clinical settings where samples must be processed individually or in small batches and (2) data sets preprocessed separately are not comparable. We propose a preprocessing algorithm, frozen RMA (fRMA), which allows one to analyze microarrays individually or in small batches and then combine the data for analysis. This is accomplished by utilizing information from the large publicly available microarray databases. In particular, estimates of probe-specific effects and variances are precomputed and frozen. Then, with new data sets, these are used in concert with information from the new arrays to normalize and summarize the data. We find that fRMA is comparable to RMA when the data are analyzed as a single batch and outperforms RMA when analyzing multiple batches. The methods described here are implemented in the R package fRMA and are currently available for download from the software section of http://rafalab.jhsph.edu.},

The microarray literature is saturated with statistical assessments based on spike-in experiment data. Unfortunately, the statistical assessments vary widely and are applicable only in specific cases. This has introduced confusion into the debate over best practices with regards to which platform, protocols and data analysis tools are best. Furthermore, cross-platform comparisons have proven difficult because reported concentrations are not comparable. In this article, we introduce two new spike-in experiments, present a novel statistical solution that enables cross-platform comparisons, and propose a comprehensive procedure for assessments based on spike-in experiments. The ideas are implemented in a user friendly Bioconductor package: spkTools.

  Abstract                 = {The protein kinase C (PKC) family of genes encode serine/threonine kinases that regulate proliferation, apoptosis, cell survival and migration. Multiple isoforms of PKC have been described, one of which is PKC . Currently, it is unclear whether PKC is involved in promoting or inhibiting cancer formation/progression. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the expression of PKC in human breast cancer and relate its levels to multiple parameters of tumour progression. Protein kinase C expression at the mRNA level was measured using real-time PCR (n=208) and at protein level by both immunoblotting (n=94) and ELISA (n=98). Following immunoblotting, two proteins were identified, migrating with molecular masses of 78 and 160kDa. The 78kDa protein is likely to be the mature form of PKC but the identity of the 160kDa form is unknown. Levels of both these proteins correlated weakly but significantly with PKC concentrations determined by ELISA (for the 78kDa form, r=0.444, P<0.005, n=91 and for the 160kDa form, r=0.237, P=0.023, n=91) and with PKC mRNA levels (for the 78kDa form, r=0.351, P=0.001, n=94 and for the 160kDa form, r=0.216, P=0.037, n=94). Protein kinase C mRNA expression was significantly higher in oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive compared with ER-negative tumours (P=0.007, MannWhitney U-test). Increasing concentrations of PKC mRNA were associated with reduced overall patient survival (P=0.004). Our results are consistent with a role for PKC in breast cancer progression.},

  Abstractnote             = {Motivation: A major challenge in utilizing microarray technologies to measure nucleic acid abundances is normalization, the goal of which is to separate biologically meaningful signal from other confounding sources of signal, often due to unavoidable technical factors. It is intuitively clear that true biological signal and confounding factors need to be simultaneously considered when performing normalization. However, the most popular normalization approaches do not utilize what is known about the study, both in terms of the biological variables of interest and the known technical factors in the study, such as batch or array processing date. Results: We show here that failing to include all study-specific biological and technical variables when performing normalization leads to biased downstream analyses. We propose a general normalization framework that fits a study-specific model employing every known variable that is relevant to the expression study. The proposed method is generally applicable to the full range of existing probe designs, as well as to both single-channel and dual-channel arrays. We show through real and simulated examples that the method has favorable operating characteristics in comparison to some of the most highly used normalization methods.

We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high-dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularisation for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for randomised Lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions needed for consistency of the original Lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Regularized regression methods such as principal component or partial least squares regression perform well in learning tasks on high dimensional spectral data, but cannot explicitly eliminate irrelevant features. The random forest classifier with its associated Gini feature importance, on the other hand, allows for an explicit feature elimination, but may not be optimally adapted to spectral data due to the topology of its constituent classification trees which are based on orthogonal splits in feature space.RESULTS:We propose to combine the best of both approaches, and evaluated the joint use of a feature selection based on a recursive feature elimination using the Gini importance of random forests' together with regularized classification methods on spectral data sets from medical diagnostics, chemotaxonomy, biomedical analytics, food science, and synthetically modified spectral data. Here, a feature selection using the Gini feature importance with a regularized classification by discriminant partial least squares regression performed as well as or better than a filtering according to different univariate statistical tests, or using regression coefficients in a backward feature elimination. It outperformed the direct application of the random forest classifier, or the direct application of the regularized classifiers on the full set of features.CONCLUSION:The Gini importance of the random forest provided superior means for measuring feature relevance on spectral data, but - on an optimal subset of features - the regularized classifiers might be preferable over the random forest classifier, in spite of their limitation to model linear dependencies only. A feature selection based on Gini importance, however, may precede a regularized linear classification to identify this optimal subset of features, and to earn a double benefit of both dimensionality reduction and the elimination of noise from the classification task.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: To better understand the impact of defects in the DNA damage-surveillance network on the various cell-based assays used for the prediction of patient radiosensitivity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We examined noncancerous human fibroblast strains from individuals with ataxia telangiectasia (ataxia telangiectasia mutated ATM deficient) or Li-Fraumeni syndrome (p53 deficient) using the neutral comet, H2AX phosphorylation, and clonogenic survival assays. RESULTS: Using the comet assay, we found that, compared with normal fibroblasts, cells lacking either ATM or p53 function exhibited a reduced rate of double-strand break (DSB) rejoining early or =4 h) after exposure to 8 Gy of gamma-radiation and also exhibited high levels of unrejoined DSBs later after irradiation. ATM-deficient and p53-deficient fibroblasts also exhibited abnormally increased levels of phosphorylated H2AX (gamma-H2AX) at later intervals after irradiation. In the clonogenic assay, ATM-deficient cells exhibited marked radiosensitivity and p53-deficient cells had varying degrees of radioresistance compared with normal fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: Regardless of whether ataxia telangiectasia and Li-Fraumeni syndrome fibroblasts are DSB-repair deficient per se, it is apparent that p53 and ATM defects greatly influence the cellular phenotype as evidenced by the neutral comet and gamma-H2AX assays. Our data suggest that the gamma-H2AX levels observed at later intervals after irradiation may represent a reliable measure of the overall DSB rejoining capabilities of human fibroblasts. However, it appears that using this parameter as a predictor of radiosensitivity without knowledge of the cells? p53 status could lead to incorrect conclusions.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Studies using microarray analysis of colorectal cancer have been generally beleaguered by the lack of a normal cell population of the same lineage as the tumor cell. One of the main objectives of this study was to generate a reference gene expression data set for normal colonic epithelium which can be used in comparisons with diseased tissues, as well as to provide a dataset that could be used as a baseline for studies in alternative splicing. Results: We present a dependable expression reference data set for non-neoplastic colonic epithelial cells. An enriched population of fresh colon epithelial cells were obtained from non-neoplastic, colectomy specimens and analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip EXON 1.0 ST arrays. For demonstration purposes, we have compared the data derived from these cells to a publically available set of tumor and matched normal colon data. This analysis allowed an assessment of global gene expression alterations and demonstrated that adjacent normal tissues, with a high degree of cellular heterogeneity, are not always representative of normal cells for comparison to tumors which arise from the colon epithelium. We also examined alternative splicing events in tumors compared to normal colon epithelial cells. Conclusions: The findings from this study represent the first comprehensive expression profile for non-neoplastic colonic epithelial cells reported. Our analysis of splice variants illustrate that this is a very labor intensive procedure, requiring vigilant examination of the data. It is projected that the contribution of this set of data derived from pure colonic epithelial cells will enhance studies in colon-related disease and offer a vital baseline for studies aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of alternative splicing.},

Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study alignment of probe sequences of the Affymetrix microarray HG-U133A with Ensembl transcript sequences was performed to define transcript-specific probe sets. Out of a total of 247,965 perfect match probes, 95,008 were designated transcript-specific, i.e. showing complete sequence alignment, no cross-hybridization, and transcript-, not only gene-specificity. These probes were grouped into 7,941 transcript-specific probe sets and 15,619 gene-specific probe sets, respectively. The former were used to differentiate 445 alternative transcripts of 215 genes. For selected transcripts, predicted by this analysis to be differentially expressed in the human kidney, confirmatory real-time RT-PCR experiments were performed. First, the expression of two specific transcripts of the genes PPM1A (PP2CAHUMAN and P35813) and PLG (PLMNHUMAN and Q5TEH5) in human kidneys was determined by the transcript-specific array analysis and confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Secondly, disease-specific differential expression of single transcripts of PLG and ABCA1 (ABCA1HUMAN and Q5VYS0HUMAN) was computed from the available array data sets and confirmed by transcript-specific real-time RT-PCR. Conclusions: Transcript-specific analysis of microarray experiments can be employed to study gene-regulation on the transcript level using conventional microarray data. In this study, predictions based on sufficient probe set size and fold-change are confirmed by independent means.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Aldehyde dehydrogenase isozymes ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 are highly expressed in non small cell lung cancer. Neither the mechanisms nor the biologic significance for such over expression have been studied. Methods: We have employed oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze changes in gene profiles in A549 lung cancer cell line in which ALDH activity was reduced by up to 95% using lentiviral mediated expression of siRNA against both isozymes (Lenti 1+3). Stringent analysis methods were used to identify gene expression patterns that are specific to the knock down of ALDH activity and significantly different in comparison to wild type A549 cells (WT) or cells similarly transduced with green fluorescent protein (GFP) siRNA. Results: We confirmed significant and specific down regulation of ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 in Lenti 1+3 cells and in comparison to 12 other ALDH genes detected. The results of the microarray analysis were validated by real time RT-PCR on RNA obtained from Lenti 1+3 or WT cells treated with ALDH activity inhibitors. Detailed functional analysis was performed on 101 genes that were significantly different (P < 0.001) and their expression changed by 2 folds in the Lenti 1+3 group versus the control groups. There were 75 down regulated and 26 up regulated genes. Protein binding, organ development, signal transduction, transcription, lipid metabolism, and cell migration and adhesion were among the most affected pathways. Conclusion: These molecular effects of the ALDH knock-down are associated with in vitro functional changes in the proliferation and motility of these cells and demonstrate the significance of ALDH enzymes in cell homeostasis with a potentially significant impact on the treatment of lung cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {Through the adoptive transfer of lymphocytes after host immunodepletion, it is possible to mediate objective cancer regression in human patients with metastatic melanoma. However, the generation of tumor-specific T cells in this mode of immunotherapy is often limiting. Here we report the ability to specifically confer tumor recognition by autologous lymphocytes from peripheral blood by using a retrovirus that encodes a T cell receptor. Adoptive transfer of these transduced cells in 15 patients resulted in durable engraftment at levels exceeding 10% of peripheral blood lymphocytes for at least 2 months after the infusion. We observed high sustained levels of circulating, engineered cells at 1 year after infusion in two patients who both demonstrated objective regression of metastatic melanoma lesions. This study suggests the therapeutic potential of genetically engineered cells for the biologic therapy of cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {The TP53 tumor suppressor gene regulates a number of genes that are involved in cell-cycle inhibition, apoptosis, and maintaining genetic stability. Recently, two genes that have a role in immunosurveillance were identified as downstream targets of TP53. These genes, TAP1 and fractalkine, may contribute to suppress tumor growth through host immunosurveillance. It has been reported that the mouse secreted phosphoprotein osteopontin (Opn) is one of the key cytokines for type 1 immune responses mediated by macrophages. It also was reported that Opn may play a role in suppressing tumor growth in vivo. Here we identified Opn as a Tp53-target gene using mRNA differential display analysis of embryonic fibroblasts from Tp53-deficient mice. Furthermore, we found that Opn expression was upregulated by DNA damage-induced Tp53 activity and by adenovirus-mediated transfer of the human TP53 gene. In addition, a luciferase assay showed that the Opn gene has a functional Tp53-responsive element in its promoter region, and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed interaction between the Opn promoter and Tp53 protein in vivo. These results suggest that OPN is a direct transcriptional target of TP53. The TP53-directed regulation of OPN expression suggests a novel model of TP53 participation in immunosurveillance, involving interaction with the host immune system to prevent damaged cells from undergoing malignant transformation.},

  Abstract                 = {A number of mammalian genomes having been sequenced, an important next step is to catalog the expression patterns of all transcription units in health and disease by use of microarrays. Such discovery programs are crucial to our understanding of the gene networks that control developmental, physiological, and pathological processes. However, despite the excitement, the full promise of microarray technology has yet to be realized, as the superficial simplicity of the concept belies considerable problems. Microarray technology is very new; methodologies are still evolving, common standards have yet to be established, and many problems with experimental design and variability have still to be fully understood and overcome. This review will describe the time course of a microarray experiment-RNA isolation from sample, target preparation, hybridization to the microarray probe, data capture, and bioinformatic analysis. For each stage, the advantages and disadvantages of competing techniques are compared, and inherent sources of error are identified and discussed.},

With the PCA method, based on the expression of 9605 genes and ESTs, classification of colon, leukaemia, renal, melanoma and CNS cells could be performed, but not of lung, breast and ovarian cells. Another multivariate procedure, called partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), provides bioinformatic clues for the selection of a limited number of gene transcripts most effective in discriminating different tumoral histotypes. Among them it is possible to identify candidates in the development of new diagnostic tests for cancer detection and unknown genes deserving high priority in further studies. In particular, melan-A, acid phosphatase 5, dopachrome tautomerase, S100-beta and acid ceramidase were found to be among the most important genes for melanoma. The potential of the present bioinformatic approach is exemplified by its ability to identify differentiation and diagnostic markers already in use in clinical settings, such as protein S-100, a prognostic parameter in patients with metastatic melanoma and a screening marker for melanoma metastasis.},

  Abstract                 = {The pro-apoptotic function of p53 has been well defined in preventing genomic instability and cell transformation. However, the intriguing fact that p53 contributes to a pro-survival advantage of tumor cells under DNA damage conditions raises a critical question in radiation therapy for the 50% human cancers with intact p53 function. Herein, we reveal an anti-apoptotic role of mitochondrial p53 regulated by the cell cycle complex cyclin B1/Cdk1 in irradiated human colon cancer HCT116 cells with p53+/+ status. Steady-state levels of p53 and cyclin B1/Cdk1 were identified in the mitochondria of many human and mouse cells, and their mitochondrial influx was significantly enhanced by radiation. The mitochondrial kinase activity of cyclin B1/Cdk1 was found to specifically phosphorylate p53 at Ser-315 residue, leading to enhanced mitochondrial ATP production and reduced mitochondrial apoptosis. The improved mitochondrial function can be blocked by transfection of mutant p53 Ser-315-Ala, or by siRNA knockdown of cyclin B1 and Cdk1 genes. Enforced translocation of cyclin B1 and Cdk1 into mitochondria with a mitochondrial-targeting-peptide increased levels of Ser-315 phosphorylation on mitochondrial p53, improved ATP production and decreased apoptosis by sequestering p53 from binding to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Furthermore, reconstitution of wild-type p53 in p53-deficient HCT116 p53/ cells resulted in an increased mitochondrial ATP production and suppression of apoptosis. Such phenomena were absent in the p53-deficient HCT116 p53/ cells reconstituted with the mutant p53. These results demonstrate a unique anti-apoptotic function of mitochondrial p53 regulated by cyclin B1/Cdk1-mediated Ser-315 phosphorylation in p53-wild-type tumor cells, which may provide insights for improving the efficacy of anti-cancer therapy, especially for tumors that retain p53.},

  Abstractnote             = {MOTIVATION: Discrimination between two classes such as normal and cancer samples and between two types of cancers based on gene expression profiles is an important problem which has practical implications as well as the potential to further our understanding of gene expression of various cancer cells. Classification or discrimination of more than two groups or classes (multi-class) is also needed. The need for multi-class discrimination methodologies is apparent in many microarray experiments where various cancer types are considered simultaneously. RESULTS: Thus, in this paper we present the extension to the classification methodology proposed earlier Nguyen and Rocke (2002b; Bioinformatics, 18, 39-50) to classify cancer samples from multiple classes. The methodologies proposed in this paper are applied to four gene expression data sets with multiple classes: (a) a hereditary breast cancer data set with (1) BRCA1-mutation, (2) BRCA2-mutation and (3) sporadic breast cancer samples, (b) an acute leukemia data set with (1) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), (2) T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and (3) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) samples, (c) a lymphoma data set with (1) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), (2) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL) and (3) follicular lymphoma (FL) samples, and (d) the NCI60 data set with cell lines derived from cancers of various sites of origin. In addition, we evaluated the classification algorithms and examined the variability of the error rates using simulations based on randomization of the real data sets. We note that there are other methods for addressing multi-class prediction recently and our approach is along the line of Nguyen and Rocke (2002b; Bioinformatics, 18, 39-50).

  Abstractnote             = {MOTIVATION: One important application of gene expression microarray data is classification of samples into categories, such as the type of tumor. The use of microarrays allows simultaneous monitoring of thousands of genes expressions per sample. This ability to measure gene expression en masse has resulted in data with the number of variables p(genes) far exceeding the number of samples N. Standard statistical methodologies in classification and prediction do not work well or even at all when N < p. Modification of existing statistical methodologies or development of new methodologies is needed for the analysis of microarray data. RESULTS: We propose a novel analysis procedure for classifying (predicting) human tumor samples based on microarray gene expressions. This procedure involves dimension reduction using Partial Least Squares (PLS) and classification using Logistic Discrimination (LD) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA). We compare PLS to the well known dimension reduction method of Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Under many circumstances PLS proves superior; we illustrate a condition when PCA particularly fails to predict well relative to PLS. The proposed methods were applied to five different microarray data sets involving various human tumor samples: (1) normal versus ovarian tumor; (2) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) versus Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL); (3) Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCLL) versus B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (BCLL); (4) normal versus colon tumor; and (5) Non-Small-Cell-Lung-Carcinoma (NSCLC) versus renal samples. Stability of classification results and methods were further assessed by re-randomization studies.},

Although it is often described as a “gold” standard, it is far from being a standard assay. The significant problems caused by variability of RNA templates, assay designs and protocols, as well as inappropriate data normalization and inconsistent data analysis, are widely known but also widely disregarded. As a first step towards standardization, we describe a series of RT-qPCR protocols that illustrate the essential technical steps required to generate quantitative data that are reliable and reproducible. We would like to emphasize, however, that RT-qPCR data constitute only a snapshot of information regarding the quantity of a given transcript in a cell or tissue. Any assessment of the biological consequences of variable mRNA levels must include additional information regarding regulatory RNAs, protein levels and protein activity. The entire protocol described here, encompassing all stages from initial assay design to reliable qPCR data analysis, requires approximately 15 h.},

  Abstract                 = {Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease characterized by the accumulation of activated T cells and widespread granuloma formation. In addition, individual genetic predisposition appears to be important in this disease. Osteopontin, a noncollagenous matrix protein produced by macrophages and T lymphocytes, is expressed in the granulomas of tuberculosis, and is associated with genetic susceptibility to intracellular infection. The function of osteopontin in these T cell-mediated responses is unknown. We sought to elucidate the role of osteopontin in granulomatous inflammation by characterizing its expression in different stages of sarcoidosis and its effector function on T cells in vitro. Lymphocyte-associated expression of osteopontin in sarcoidosis was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, and its expression correlated with granuloma maturity. In addition, osteopontin induced T cell chemotaxis, supported T cell adhesion (an effect enhanced by thrombin cleavage of osteopontin), and costimulated T cell proliferation. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which osteopontin and thrombin modulate T cell recruitment and activation in granulomatous inflammation.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: To identify papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC)-associated transcripts, we compared the gene expression profiles of three Serial Analysis of Gene Expression libraries generated from thyroid tumors and a normal thyroid tissue. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Selected transcripts were validated in a panel of 57 thyroid tumors using quantitative PCR (qPCR). An independent set of 71 paraffin-embedded sections was used for validation using immunohistochemical analysis. To determine if PTC-associated gene expression could predict lymph node involvement, a separate cohort of 130 primary PTC (54 metastatic and 76 nonmetastatic) was investigated. The BRAF(V600E) mutational status was compared with qPCR data to identify genes that might be regulated by abnormal BRAF/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling. RESULTS: We identified and validated new PTC-associated transcripts. Three genes (CST6, CXCL14, and DHRS3) are strongly associated with PTC. Immunohistochemical analysis of CXCL14 confirmed the qPCR data and showed protein expression in PTC epithelial cells. We also observed that CST6, CXCL14, DHRS3, and SPP1 were associated with PTC lymph node metastasis, with CST6, CXCL14, and SPP1 being positively correlated with metastasis and DHRS3 being negatively correlated. Finally, we found a strong correlation between CST6 and CXCL14 expression and BRAF(V600E) mutational status, suggesting that these genes may be induced subsequently to BRAF activation and therefore may be downstream in the BRAF/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: CST6, CXCL14, DHRS3, and SPP1 may play a role in PTC pathogenesis and progression and are possible molecular targets for PTC therapy.},

In order to rank genes accordingly, many different scores have been proposed, ranging from ad hoc modifications of the ordinary t statistic to complicated hierarchical Bayesian models. Here, we introduce the "shrinkage t" statistic that is based on a novel and model-free shrinkage estimate of the variance vector across genes. This is derived in a quasi-empirical Bayes setting. The new rank score is fully automatic and requires no specification of parameters or distributions. It is computationally inexpensive and can be written analytically in closed form. Using a series of synthetic and three real expression data we studied the quality of gene rankings produced by the "shrinkage t" statistic. The new score consistently leads to highly accurate rankings for the complete range of investigated data sets and all considered scenarios for across-gene variance structures.},

  Abstractnote             = {Background: Since its introduction quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) has become the standard method for quantification of gene expression. Its high sensitivity, large dynamic range, and accuracy led to the development of numerous applications with an increasing number of samples to be analyzed. Data analysis consists of a number of steps, which have to be carried out in several different applications. Currently, no single tool is available which incorporates storage, management, and multiple methods covering the complete analysis pipeline. Results: QPCR is a versatile web-based Java application that allows to store, manage, and analyze data from relative quantification qPCR experiments. It comprises a parser to import generated data from qPCR instruments and includes a variety of analysis methods to calculate cycle-threshold and amplification efficiency values. The analysis pipeline includes technical and biological replicate handling, incorporation of sample or gene specific efficiency, normalization using single or multiple reference genes, inter-run calibration, and fold change calculation. Moreover, the application supports assessment of error propagation throughout all analysis steps and allows conducting statistical tests on biological replicates. Results can be visualized in customizable charts and exported for further investigation. Conclusion: We have developed a web-based system designed to enhance and facilitate the analysis of qPCR experiments. It covers the complete analysis workflow combining parsing, analysis, and generation of charts into one single application. The system is freely available at},

Our analysis is based on a random sampling approach using real data sets from 16 published studies. We consider both the ability to find genes that meet particular statistical criteria as well as the stability of the results in the face of changing levels of replication. RESULTS: While dependent on the data source, our findings suggest that stable results are typically not obtained until at least five biological replicates have been used. Conversely, for most studies, 10-15 replicates yield results that are quite stable, and there is less improvement in stability as the number of replicates is further increased. Our methods will be of use in evaluating existing data sets and in helping to design new studies.},

Despite a wide range of approaches, the same principles underlie all data analysis, with standard approaches broadly classified as either absolute or relative. In this study we use a variety of absolute and relative approaches of data analysis to investigate nocturnal c-fos expression in wild-type and retinally degenerate mice. In addition, we apply a simple algorithm to calculate the amplification efficiency of every sample from its amplification profile. We confirm that nocturnal c-fos expression in the rodent eye originates from the photoreceptor layer, with around a 5-fold reduction in nocturnal c-fos expression in mice lacking rods and cones. Furthermore, we illustrate that differences in the results obtained from absolute and relative approaches are underpinned by differences in the calculated PCR efficiency. By calculating the amplification efficiency from the samples under analysis, comparable results may be obtained without the need for standard curves. We have automated this method to provide a means of streamlining the real-time PCR process, enabling analysis of experimental samples based upon their own reaction kinetics rather than those of artificial standards.},

  Abstractnote             = {High throughput technologies, such as gene expression arrays and protein mass spectrometry, allow one to simultaneously evaluate thousands of potential biomarkers that could distinguish different tissue types. Of particular interest here is distinguishing between cancerous and normal organ tissues. We consider statistical methods to rank genes (or proteins) in regards to differential expression between tissues. Various statistical measures are considered, and we argue that two measures related to the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve are particularly suitable for this purpose. We also propose that sampling variability in the gene rankings be quantified, and suggest using the “selection probability function,” the probability distribution of rankings for each gene. This is estimated via the bootstrap. A real dataset, derived from gene expression arrays of 23 normal and 30 ovarian cancer tissues, is analyzed. Simulation studies are also used to assess the relative performance of different statistical gene ranking measures and our quantification of sampling variability. Our approach leads naturally to a procedure for sample-size calculations, appropriate for exploratory studies that seek to identify differentially expressed genes.},

  Abstract                 = {Use of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify cDNA products reverse transcribed from mRNA is on the way to becoming a routine tool in molecular biology to study low abundance gene expression. Real-time PCR is easy to perform, provides the necessary accuracy and produces reliable as well as rapid quantification results. But accurate quantification of nucleic acids requires a reproducible methodology and an adequate mathematical model for data analysis. This study enters into the particular topics of the relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR of a target gene transcript in comparison to a reference gene transcript. Therefore, a new mathematical model is presented. The relative expression ratio is calculated only from the real-time PCR efficiencies and the crossing point deviation of an unknown sample versus a control. This model needs no calibration curve. Control levels were included in the model to standardise each reaction run with respect to RNA integrity, sample loading and inter-PCR variations. High accuracy and reproducibility (<2.5% variation) were reached in LightCycler PCR using the established mathematical model.},

This paper focuses on the application of a supervised classification technique, support vector machines (SVM), to high dimensional microarrays for marker identification. A case study of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is used here to demonstrate and test the ability of SVMs to identify real biological markers. SVMs are known to be suitable for high dimensional microarray data and are able to classify non-linear relationships in the data through the use of kernel functions specific to the datasets. This paper compares multiple SVM kernel functions, both linear and nonlinear, to determine which form is best suited for a particular dataset. Additionally, each SVM is tested across a range of parameters and normalization schemes to further identify a specific optimal classifier. Empirical results are then used to determine the optimum parameters for the SVM to efficiently find biologically important predictive markers for differentiation between RCC subtypes for the purpose of diagnosis and prognosis.},

  Abstract                 = {RET/PTC rearrangements represent key genetic events involved in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) initiation. The aim of the present study was to identify the early changes in gene expression induced by RET/PTC in thyroid cells. For this purpose, microarray analysis was conducted on PCCL3 cells conditionally expressing the RET/PTC3 oncogene. Gene expression profiling 48 h after activation of RET/PTC3 identified a statistically significant modification of expression of 270 genes. Quantitative PCR confirmation of 20 of these demonstrated 90% accuracy of the microarray. Functional clustering of genes with greater than or less than 1.75-fold expression change (86 genes) revealed RET/PTC3-induced regulation of genes with key functions in apoptosis (Ripk3, Tdga), cell-cell signaling (Cdh6, Fn1), cell cycle (Il24), immune and inflammation response (Cxcl10, Scya2, Il6, Gbp2, Oas1, Tap1, RT1Aw2, C2ta, Irf1, Lmp2, Psme2, Prkr), metabolism (Aldob, Ptges, Nd2, Gss, Gstt1), signal transduction (Socs3, Nf1, Jak2, Cpg21, Dusp6, Socs1, Stat1, Stat3, Cish) and transcription (Nr4a1, Junb, Hfh1, Runx1, Foxe1). Genes coding for proteins involved in the immune response and in intracellular signal transduction pathways activated by cytokines and chemokines were strongly represented, indicating a critical role of RET/PTC3 in the early modulation of the immune response.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer metastases result in a significant number of cancer related deaths. The molecular mechanisms underlying this complex, multi-step pathway are yet to be completely elucidated. In the absence of any transgenic models of colon cancer metastases, an in vivo model system that fulfills the rate limiting steps of metastasis (local invasion and distant colony formation) is needed. The purpose of this study was to characterize the behavior of a human colon cancer cell line, HCT116 in an orthotopic model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HCT116 cells were transfected with green fluorescence protein and subcutaneously injected into BALB/c nude male mice. Once xenografts were established, they were excised and orthotopically implanted into 32 other male BALB/c nude mice using microsurgical techniques. Animals were serially imaged and euthanized at 6-8 weeks post-implantation. Tissues were procured and processed for hematoxylin and eosin analysis. RESULTS: All 32 animals demonstrated primary tumor growth, invasion and peritoneal spread. Liver metastases were identified in 15/32 (47%), and lung metastases were confirmed in 13/32 (41%). In total, 19/32 (59%) animals demonstrated distant metastatic colony formation. CONCLUSIONS: This orthotopic model of colon cancer fulfills the rate limiting steps of local invasion and distant colony formation in the process of metastases. HCT116 human colon cancer cell line in this in vivo model system provides a tool to dissect the molecular mechanism involved in the metastatic cascade.},

  Abstractnote             = {Quantification of mRNAs using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by monitoring the product formation with the fluorescent dye SYBR Green I is being extensively used in neurosciences, developmental biology, and medical diagnostics. Most PCR data analysis procedures assume that the PCR efficiency for the amplicon of interest is constant or even, in the case of the comparative C(t) method, equal to 2. The latter method already leads to a 4-fold error when the PCR efficiencies vary over just a 0.04 range. PCR efficiencies of amplicons are usually calculated from standard curves based on either known RNA inputs or on dilution series of a reference cDNA sample. In this paper we show that the first approach can lead to PCR efficiencies that vary over a 0.2 range, whereas the second approach may be off by 0.26. Therefore, we propose linear regression on the Log(fluorescence) per cycle number data as an assumption-free method to calculate starting concentrations of mRNAs and PCR efficiencies for each sample. A computer program to perform this calculation is available on request (e-mail: bioinfoamc.uva.nl; subject: LinRegPCR).},

  Abstract                 = {Persons at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) demonstrate altered cortical activation measured by functional MRI (fMRI) years before symptoms of disease are expected. We used fMRI to study the differences in cortical activation between 13 women with a family history of AD and at least one apolipoprotein E4 allele, a risk factor for AD, and a control group of 11 women lacking both factors. Our primary goal was to assess how well the two groups are able to be statistically separated, a task which directly affects the performance of post hoc classification. The dimension of the dataset, however, precludes the use of ordinary classification methods. In this paper we show the superiority of using Oriented Partial Least Squares (OrPLS) to accomplish the classification in the presence of this dimensionality problem. We are able to reduce the misclassification rates on the standardized fMRI data from an average of about 48\% for PCA, to an average of 27\% for PLS, and then to perfect classification for OrPLS.},

IZOLACJA CA£KOWITEGO RNA Z ROŒLIN 


Izolacja RNA jest pierwszym etapem prac maj¹cych na celu poznanie ekspresji badanych genów. RNA po izolacji mo¿e byæ 

wykorzystany do nastêpuj¹cych celów. 


1. Ustalenia czy dany gen ulega ekspresji w badanym uk³adzie biologicznym. Ekspresjê badanych genów mo¿na stwierdziæ 

wykorzystuj¹c amplifikacji typu RT-PCR lub test hybrydyzacji. 


2. Klonowania cDNA. Cz¹steczki RNA, po przepisaniu na cDNA w reakcji RT-PCR, mog¹ zostaæ wklonowanie do wybranego 

wektora genetycznego. Pula cz¹steczek cDNA reprezentuj¹cych wszystkie mRNA danej tkanki stanowi bibliotekê cDNA. 


3. Poznania budowy badanego genu. Sekwencja cDNA danego genu, mo¿e zostaæ porównana z sekwencj¹ genomow¹ tego 

genu, co umo¿liwia identyfikacjê pozycji eksonów i intronów a tak¿e koñca 3’ transkryptu. Koniec 5’ transkryptu mo¿na 

zlokalizowaæ wykorzystuj¹c test primer-extension. D³ugoœæ cz¹steczek mRNA badanych genów mo¿na ustaliæ za pomoc¹ 

hybrydyzacji typu Northern-blot. 


4. Ustalenia poziomu ekspresji badanych genów za pomoc¹ real time PCR lub hybrydyzacji typu Northern-blot. 

Stosowane metody izolacji RNA powinny umo¿liwiaæ uzyskanie RNA niezdegradowanego, o wysokim stopniu czystoœci. 


Izolacja mRNA przebiega zasadniczo w podobnych etapach jak izolacja DNA. G³ówne ró¿nice wynikaj¹ z nastêpuj¹cych faktów. 


1. RNA jest znacznie bardziej nara¿ony na degradacjê ni¿ DNA. W materiale biologicznym oraz w œrodowisku zewnêtrznym 

obecna jest du¿a iloœci bardzo aktywnych i stabilnych rybonukleaz. Nawet po zastosowaniu wysokiej temperatury, np. 100oC, 

a tak¿e w obecnoœci detergentów, tj. SDS, enzymy te zachowuj¹ wysok¹ aktywnoœæ. Ponadto, wiele rybonukleaz nie wymaga 

dla swej aktywnoœci kofaktorów, np. jonów dwuwartoœciowych, w zwi¹zku z czym aktywnoœci tych enzymów nie mo¿emy 

zablokowaæ stosuj¹c EDTA. Dlatego podczas izolacji RNA do inaktywacji RNaz nale¿y stosowaæ bardzo silne zwi¹zki 

degraduj¹ce bia³ka, takie jak chlorowodorek guanidyny lub izotiocjanian guanidyny. Zwi¹zki te, oprócz degradacji 

rybonukleaz, umo¿liwiaj¹ równie¿ zniszczenie struktur komórkowych. RNazy powinny zostaæ równie¿ usuniête ze sprzêtu 

u¿ywanego do izolacji. Do tego celu stosuje siê inhibitory RNaz, tj. DEPC (dietylopirowêglan). W postaci 0,1% roztworu 

wykorzystujemy go do p³ukania sprzêtu maj¹cego kontakt z RNA oraz do przygotowywania niektórych buforów. Roztwór 

ten po autoklawowaniu inaktywuj¹cym DEPC, u¿ywany jest równie¿ do przechowywania RNA jako tzw. H2ODEPC. Nale¿y 

pamiêtaæ, ¿e 0,1% DEPC nie poddany inaktywacji inhibuje aktywnoœæ enzymów s³u¿¹cych do prac z RNA, np. odwrotnej 

transkryptazy. Kolejnym, czêsto stosowanym inhibitorem RNaz, jest tzw. RNazin - bia³ko które inaktywuje RNazy wi¹¿¹c 

siê z nimi. Inhibitor ten mo¿e towarzyszyæ RNA podczas przechowywania oraz podczas reakcji enzymatycznych, gdy¿ nie 

powoduje inhibicji innych enzymów. 


2. Podczas izolacji RNA nale¿y usun¹æ towarzysz¹cy mu DNA. W tym celu stosuje siê miêdzy innymi ekstrakcjê fenolem o 

niskim pH. Kwaœny fenol powoduje usuniêcie nadmiaru DNA z roztworu. Dok³adne usuniêcie resztek DNA z preparatu 

mo¿na natomiast uzyskaæ wykonuj¹c trawienie DNA-z¹ woln¹ od RNA-az. RNA pozbawiony DNA mo¿na równie¿ uzyskaæ

Commonly, normalization of the target gene with an endogenous standard, mainly housekeeping genes (HKGs), is applied. However, differences in the expression levels of endogenous reference genes have been reported between different tissues and pathological states. Therefore, we were challenged to identify a set of endogenous reference genes whose mRNA expression levels would not change significantly between normal and cancerous tissues. Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-RT-PCR) analysis was applied to evaluate the variability in gene expression among 21 classical housekeeping genes in colorectal, pancreatic, esophageal and gastric cancer as well as in liver metastases in comparison to the corresponding normal tissue. Our results indicated that some housekeeping genes were candidates with relatively stable gene expression in several of the investigated tissues but for most of the HKGs under investigation our data have revealed distinct differences in the extent of variability in gene expression between the different tissues and pathological states. However, for each of the five tissues investigated we found a group of genes that were expressed at a constant level thus representing a panel of candidates that we can recommend as housekeeping genes in the respective tissue types. In summary, our results can be used as guidance for other scientists studying various carcinomas for tissue-specific selection of the optimal housekeeping gene (HKG) to be used in normalizing target gene expression.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the prevalence of BRCA1, BRCA2, and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer gene mutations in a large, unselected population of ovarian cancer patients and to evaluate the relationship between mutation status and a routinely obtained family history of cancer. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred sixteen consecutive ovarian cancer patients seen for routine clinical care were examined for BRCA1, BRCA2, hMSH2, and hMLH1 gene mutations with use of the polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and direct gene sequencing. Fisher?s exact test was used to evaluate possible associations between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status and specific familial characteristics. RESULTS: Among 116 unselected ovarian cancer patients we identified a total of 13 germline mutations in 12 patients: 10 in BRCA1, one each in hMSH2 and hMLH1, and a single BRCA2 mutation, which occurred in a patient also carrying a BRCA1 mutation. More than half the patients with BRCA1 mutations had family histories that would generally be considered unremarkable. Of 22 family history variables analyzed, only two (maternal family history of breast or ovarian cancer, p=0.037, and maternal family history of any cancer, p=0.020) conferred a significantly increased risk of carrying a BRCA1 mutation compared with ovarian cancer patients without such a history. However, the majority of ovarian cancer patients with these family histories and other suggestive histories tested negative for mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 10% of ovarian cancers occur in association with genetic mutations known to predispose to the disease. A routinely obtained family history is an unreliable way to identify patients who might harbor mutations. The majority of ovarian cancer patients with suggestive family histories test negative for known gene mutations, perhaps suggesting the existence of additional undiscovered genes predisposing to ovarian cancer.},

Nevertheless, the full potential of this technology has yet to be realized, primarily due to the limitations of the threshold-based methodologies that are currently used for quantitative analysis. Prone to errors caused by variations in reaction preparation and amplification conditions, these approaches necessitate construction of standard curves for each target sequence, significantly limiting the development of high-throughput applications that demand substantive levels of reliability and automation. In this study, an alternative approach based upon fitting of fluorescence data to a four-parametric sigmoid function is shown to dramatically increase both the utility and reliability of quantitative real-time PCR. By mathematically modeling individual amplification reactions, quantification can be achieved without the use of standard curves and without prior knowledge of amplification efficiency. Combined with provision of quantitative scale via optical calibration, sigmoidal curve-fitting could confer the capability for fully automated quantification of nucleic acids with unparalleled accuracy and reliability.},

  Abstract                 = {We have examined the proteins secreted into the growth medium by normal and transformed cells. Transformed cell lines from several mammalian species all secrete proteins in the 58,000 dalton molecular weight range. These proteins are all immunologically related and are secreted at low levels or not at all by the parental normal cell lines. Secretion of the 58K proteins occurs with either DNA or RNA virus transformation and with spontaneous transformation. The transformed cells also secrete phosphoproteins in the same size range, but these are immunologically distinct from the 58K proteins mentioned above. The sizes of the phosphoproteins are species-specific and unrelated to the transforming virus. Incubation of conditioned media from transformed cell cultures with gamma-32P-ATP labels phosphoproteins of the same sizes, indicating the presence in the media of both protein kinase and substrate. All three properties (58K protein, phosphoprotein, in vitro phosphorylation) are closely correlated with transformation in cells transformed by temperature-sensitive viruses. The biological implications of these results remain unknown, but the results may be relevant to recent data on the (phospho)proteins and protein kinase encoded by RNA tumor viruses and the molecular basis of the transformed phenotype.},

  Abstract                 = {The selection abilities of the two well-known techniques of variable selection, synergy interval-partial least-squares (SiPLS) and genetic algorithm-partial least-squares (GA-PLS), have been examined and compared. By using different simulated and real (corn and metabolite) datasets, keeping in view the spectral overlapping of the components, the influence of the selection of either intervals of variables or individual variables on the prediction performances was examined. In the simulated datasets, with decrease in the overlapping of the spectra of components and cases with components of narrow bands, GA-PLS results were better. In contrast, the performance of SiPLS was higher for data of intermediate overlapping. For mixtures of high overlapping analytes, GA-PLS showed slightly better performance. However, significant differences between the results of the two selection methods were not observed in most of the cases. Although SiPLS resulted in slightly better performance of prediction in the case of corn dataset except for the prediction of the moisture content, the improvement obtained by SiPLS compared with that by GA-PLS was not significant. For real data of less overlapped components (metabolite dataset), GA-PLS that tends to select far fewer variables did not give significantly better root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV), cross-validated R[2] (Q[2]), and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) compared with SiPLS. Irrespective of the type of dataset, GA-PLS resulted in models with fewer latent variables (LVs). When comparing the computational time of the methods, GA-PLS is considered superior to SiPLS.},

  Abstractnote             = {Background: Reproducibility is a fundamental requirement in scientific experiments. Some recent publications have claimed that microarrays are unreliable because lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are not reproducible in similar experiments. Meanwhile, new statistical methods for identifying DEGs continue to appear in the scientific literature. The resultant variety of existing and emerging methods exacerbates confusion and continuing debate in the microarray community on the appropriate choice of methods for identifying reliable DEG lists. Results: Using the data sets generated by the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project, we investigated the impact on the reproducibility of DEG lists of a few widely used gene selection procedures. We present comprehensive results from inter-site comparisons using the same microarray platform, cross-platform comparisons using multiple microarray platforms, and comparisons between microarray results and those from TaqMan the widely regarded “standard” gene expression platform. Our results demonstrate that (1) previously reported discordance between DEG lists could simply result from ranking and selecting DEGs solely by statistical significance (P) derived from widely used simple t-tests; (2) when fold change (FC) is used as the ranking criterion with a non-stringent P-value cutoff filtering, the DEG lists become much more reproducible, especially when fewer genes are selected as differentially expressed, as is the case in most microarray studies; and (3) the instability of short DEG lists solely based on P-value ranking is an expected mathematical consequence of the high variability of the t-values; the more stringent the P-value threshold, the less reproducible the DEG list is. These observations are also consistent with results from extensive simulation calculations. Conclusion: We recommend the use of FC-ranking plus a non-stringent P cutoff as a straightforward and baseline practice in order to generate more reproducible DEG lists. Specifically, the P-value cutoff should not be stringent (too small) and FC should be as large as possible. Our results provide practical guidance to choose the appropriate FC and P-value cutoffs when selecting a given number of DEGs. The FC criterion enhances reproducibility, whereas the P criterion balances sensitivity and specificity.},

  Abstractnote             = {Objectives: The osteoplant is an equine, flexible, heterologous, deantigenic, cortical, and spongy bone tissue, totally reabsorbable, used for implantation of bone tissue, to restore skeletal, even weight-bearing structures. However, how the osteoplant alters osteoblast activity to promote bone formation is poorly understood. Materials and Methods: To study how the osteoplant induces osteoblast differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells, the expression levels of bone-related genes, and mesenchymal stem cell markers are analyzed, using real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Results: The osteoplant causes induction of osteoblast transcriptional factors such as osterix (RUNX2), and of bone-related genes such as osteopontin (SPP1) and osteocalcin (BGLAP). In contrast the expression of ENG (CD105) is significantly decreased in stem cells treated with osteoplant, with respect to untreated cells, indicating the differentiation effect of this biomaterial on stem cells. Conclusion: The obtained results can be relevant to better understand the molecular mechanism of bone regeneration and as a model for comparing other materials with similar clinical effects.},

  Abstractnote             = {Background: Fitting four-parameter sigmoidal models is one of the methods established in the analysis of quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) data. We had observed that these models are not optimal in the fitting outcome due to the inherent constraint of symmetry around the point of inflection. Thus, we found it necessary to employ a mathematical algorithm that circumvents this problem and which utilizes an additional parameter for accommodating asymmetrical structures in sigmoidal qPCR data. Results: The four-parameter models were compared to their five-parameter counterparts by means of nested F-tests based on the residual variance, thus acquiring a statistical measure for higher performance. For nearly all qPCR data we examined, five-parameter models resulted in a significantly better fit. Furthermore, accuracy and precision for the estimation of efficiencies and calculation of quantitative ratios were assessed with four independent dilution datasets and compared to the most commonly used quantification methods. It could be shown that the five-parameter model exhibits an accuracy and precision more similar to the non-sigmoidal quantification methods. Conclusion: The five-parameter sigmoidal models outperform the established four-parameter model with high statistical significance. The estimation of essential PCR parameters such as PCR efficiency, threshold cycles and initial template fluorescence is more robust and has smaller variance. The model is implemented in the qpcR package for the freely available statistical R environment. The package can be downloaded from the author?s homepage.},

  Abstractnote             = {MOTIVATION: Cancer diagnosis is one of the most important emerging clinical applications of gene expression microarray technology. We are seeking to develop a computer system for powerful and reliable cancer diagnostic model creation based on microarray data. To keep a realistic perspective on clinical applications we focus on multicategory diagnosis. To equip the system with the optimum combination of classifier, gene selection and cross-validation methods, we performed a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of several major algorithms for multicategory classification, several gene selection methods, multiple ensemble classifier methods and two cross-validation designs using 11 datasets spanning 74 diagnostic categories and 41 cancer types and 12 normal tissue types. RESULTS: Multicategory support vector machines (MC-SVMs) are the most effective classifiers in performing accurate cancer diagnosis from gene expression data. The MC-SVM techniques by Crammer and Singer, Weston and Watkins and one-versus-rest were found to be the best methods in this domain. MC-SVMs outperform other popular machine learning algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors, backpropagation and probabilistic neural networks, often to a remarkable degree. Gene selection techniques can significantly improve the classification performance of both MC-SVMs and other non-SVM learning algorithms. Ensemble classifiers do not generally improve performance of the best non-ensemble models. These results guided the construction of a software system GEMS (Gene Expression Model Selector) that automates high-quality model construction and enforces sound optimization and performance estimation procedures. This is the first such system to be informed by a rigorous comparative analysis of the available algorithms and datasets. AVAILABILITY: The software system GEMS is available for download from http://www.gems-system.org for non-commercial use. CONTACT:},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Reproducibility of results can have a significant impact on the acceptance of new technologies in gene expression analysis. With the recent introduction of the so-called next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology and established microarrays, one is able to choose between two completely different platforms for gene expression measurements. This study introduces a novel methodology for gene-ranking stability analysis that is applied to the evaluation of gene-ranking reproducibility on NGS and microarray data. RESULTS: The same data used in a well-known MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) study was also used in this study to compare ranked lists of genes from MAQC samples A and B, obtained from Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 and Roche 454 Genome Sequencer FLX platforms. An initial evaluation, where the percentage of overlapping genes was observed, demonstrates higher reproducibility on microarray data in 10 out of 11 gene-ranking methods. A gene set enrichment analysis shows similar enrichment of top gene sets when NGS is compared with microarrays on a pathway level. Our novel approach demonstrates high accuracy of decision trees when used for knowledge extraction from multiple bootstrapped gene set enrichment analysis runs. A comparison of the two approaches in sample preparation for high-throughput sequencing shows that alternating decision trees represent the optimal knowledge representation method in comparison with classical decision trees. CONCLUSIONS: Usual reproducibility measurements are mostly based on statistical techniques that offer very limited biological insights into the studied gene expression data sets. This paper introduces the meta-learning-based gene set enrichment analysis that can be used to complement the analysis of gene-ranking stability estimation techniques such as percentage of overlapping genes or classic gene set enrichment analysis. It is useful and practical when reproducibility of gene ranking results or different gene selection techniques is observed. The proposed method reveals very accurate descriptive models that capture the co-enrichment of gene sets which are differently enriched in the compared data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {The classification of genomic and proteomic data in extremely high dimensional datasets is a well-known problem which requires appropriate classification techniques. Classification methods are usually combined with gene selection techniques to provide optimal classification conditions—i.e. a lower dimensional classification environment. Another reason for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets is their interpretability, as it is much easier to interpret a small set of ranked genes than 20 thousand genes. This paper evaluates the classification performance of Rotation Forest classifier on small subsets of ranked genes for two dataset collections consisting of 47 genomic and proteomic classification problems. Robustness and high classification accuracy is shown to be an important feature of Rotation Forest when applied to small sets of genes.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiple-hypothesis testing involves guarding against much more complicated errors than single-hypothesis testing. Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approachwe fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power.We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the BenjaminiHochberg FDR method.},

These differ in terms of underlying test statistics and procedures employed for statistical learning.RESULTS:A unifying algorithm for simultaneous estimation of both local FDR and tail area-based FDR is presented that can be applied to a diverse range of test statistics, including p-values, correlations, z- and t-scores. This approach is semipararametric and is based on a modified Grenander density estimator. For test statistics other than p-values it allows for empirical null modeling, so that dependencies among tests can be taken into account. The inference of the underlying model employs truncated maximum-likelihood estimation, with the cut-off point chosen according to the false non-discovery rate.CONCLUSION:The proposed procedure generalizes a number of more specialized algorithms and thus offers a common framework for FDR estimation consistent across test statistics and types of FDR. In comparative study the unified approach performs on par with the best competing yet more specialized alternatives. The algorithm is implemented in R in the "fdrtool" package, available under the GNU GPL from http://strimmerlab.org/software/fdrtool/ and from the R package archive CRAN.},

  Abstractnote             = {Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and partial least squares (PLS) are well-known techniques for feature extraction from two sets of multi-dimensional variables. The fundamental difference between CCA and PLS is that CCA maximizes the correlation while PLS maximizes the covariance. Although both CCA and PLS have been applied successfully in various applications, the intrinsic relationship between them remains unclear. In this paper, we attempt to address this issue by showing the equivalence relationship between CCA and orthonormalized partial least squares (OPLS), a variant of PLS. We further extend the equivalence relationship to the case when regularization is employed for both sets of variables. In addition, we show that the CCA projection for one set of variables is independent of the regularization on the other set of variables. We have performed experimental studies using both synthetic and real data sets and our results confirm the established equivalence relationship. The presented analysis provides novel insights into the connection between these two existing algorithms as well as the effect of the regularization.},

  Abstractnote             = {This study addresses the problem of PCR inhibition by reverse transcriptase. It has been shown that the inhibition occurs mostly when a small amount of RNA is taken for RT reaction, and it is more visible for rarely expressed transcripts. We show here that the inhibition takes place regardless of what amount of template is utilized for RT. The inhibition possesses a global nature, i.e. the amplification of any given transcript may be compromised with different levels of inhibition. The process of inhibition also explains wrongfully derived PCR amplification efficiencies, sometimes more than 100%, when the sequential dilutions of unpurified RT sample are utilized to build the calibration curve. The RT influences PCR not only by inhibiting it. When microgram(s) of RNA are taken for RT reaction, reverse transcriptase may cause overamplification of some transcripts under certain PCR conditions. The possible mechanism of RT influence on PCR is presented, and a purification method is implemented to remove the effects of RT on PCR.},

Three biological replicates were prepared for each condition, and three experimental replicates were produced for the first biological replicate. RNA was labeled and hybridized to microarrays from three major suppliers according to manufacturers' protocols, and gene expression measurements were obtained using each platform's standard software. For each platform, gene targets from a subset of 2009 common genes were compared. Correlations in gene expression levels and comparisons for significant gene expression changes in this subset were calculated, and showed considerable divergence across the different platforms, suggesting the need for establishing industrial manufacturing standards, and further independent and thorough validation of the technology.},

  Abstractnote             = {High-throughput DNA microarray provides an effective approach to the monitoring of expression levels of thousands of genes in a sample simultaneously. One promising application of this technology is the molecular diagnostics of cancer, e.g. to distinguish normal tissue from tumor or to classify tumors into different types or subtypes. One problem arising from the use of microarray data is how to analyze the high-dimensional gene expression data, typically with thousands of variables (genes) and much fewer observations (samples). There is a need to develop reliable classification methods to make full use of microarray data and to evaluate accurately the predictive ability and reliability of such derived models. In this paper, discriminant partial least squares was used to classify the different types of human tumors using four microarray datasets and showed good prediction performance. Four different cross-validation procedures (leave-one-out versus leave-half-out; incomplete versus full) were used to evaluate the classification model. Our results indicate that discriminant partial least squares using leave-half-out cross-validation provides a more realistic estimate of the predictive ability of a classification model, which may be overestimated by some of the cross-validation procedures, and the information obtained from different cross-validation procedures can be used to evaluate the reliability of the classification model.},

Although exhibiting good predictive performance, some derived signatures are unstable due to noises arising from measurement variability and biological differences. Improvements in measurement, annotation, and signature selection methods have been proposed. We explored a new signature selection method that incorporates consensus scoring of multiple random sampling and multistep evaluation of gene-ranking consistency for maximally avoiding erroneous elimination of predictor genes. This method was tested by using a well-studied 62-sample colon cancer data set and two other cancer data sets (86-sample lung adenocarcinoma and 60-sample hepatocellular carcinoma). For the colon cancer data set, the derived signatures of 20 sampling sets, composed of 10,000 training test sets, are fairly stable with 80% of top 50 and 69% to 93% of all predictor genes shared by all 20 signatures. These shared predictor genes include 48 cancer-related and 16 cancer-implicated genes, as well as 50% of the previously derived predictor genes. The derived signatures outperform all previously derived signatures in predicting colon cancer outcomes from an independent data set collected from the Stanford Microarray Database. Our method showed similar performance for the other two data sets, suggesting its usefulness in deriving stable signatures for biomarker and target discovery.},

  Abstract                 = {Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a potent trophic gut hormone, yet its function in ruminants is relatively unknown. Experiment 1 was conducted as a pilot study to establish the presence of GLP-2 in ruminants and to ascertain whether it was responsive to increased nutrition, as in non-ruminants. Concentrations of intact GLP-2 in the blood and gut epithelial mRNA expression of proglucagon (GCG) and the GLP-2 receptor (GLP2R) were measured in 4 ruminally, duodenally, and ileally cannulated steers. Steers were fed to meet 0.75 x NE(M) for 21 d, and then increased to 1.75 x NE(M) requirement for another 29 d. Blood samples and ruminal, duodenal, and ileal epithelium biopsies were collected at low intake (Days -6 and -3), acute high intake (Days 1 and 3), and chronic high intake (Days 7 and 29) periods. Experiment 2 investigated the mRNA expression pattern of GCG and GLP2R in epithelial tissue obtained from the forestomachs (rumen, omasum, and abomasum) and intestines (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon) of 18 forage-fed Angus steers (260 kg BW). In Experiments 1 and 2, real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that expression of GCG and GLP2R mRNA was detectable in forestomach tissues, but expression was greater (P < 0.001) in small intestinal and colon tissue. High energy intake tended (P = 0.07) to increase plasma GLP-2 during the acute period and was paralleled by a 78% increase (P = 0.07) in ileal GCG mRNA expression. After this initial adaptation, duodenal GCG mRNA expression increased (P = 0.08) during the chronic high intake period. Duodenal GLP2R mRNA expression was not affected by energy intake, but ileal GLP2R expression was increased after 29 d of high energy intake compared to both the low and acute high intake periods (P = 0.001 and P = 0.01, respectively). These data demonstrate that cattle express GCG and GLP2R mRNA primarily in small intestinal and colon tissues. Increased nutrient intake increases ileal GCG mRNA and plasma GLP-2, suggesting that GLP-2 may play a role in the trophic response of the ruminant gastrointestinal tract to increased feed intake.},

  Abstract                 = {A new procedure with high ability to enhance prediction of multivariate calibration models with a small number of interpretable variables is presented. The core of this methodology is to sort the variables from an informative vector, followed by a systematic investigation of PLS regression models with the aim of finding the most relevant set of variables by comparing the cross-validation parameters of the models obtained. In this work, seven main informative vectors i.e. regression vector, correlation vector, residual vector, variable influence on projection (VIP), net analyte signal (NAS), covariance procedures vector (CovProc), signal-to-noise ratios vector (StN) and their combinations were automated and tested with the main purpose of feature selection. Six data sets from different sources were employed to validate this methodology. They originated from: near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, gas chromatography (GC), fluorescence spectroscopy, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and computer simulation. The results indicate that all vectors and their combinations were able to enhance prediction capability with respect to the full data sets. However, regression and NAS informative vectors from partial least squares (PLS) regression, both built using more latent variables than when building the model presented in most of tested data sets, were the best informative vectors for variable selection. In all the applications, the selected variables were quite effective and useful for interpretation.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso? minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

  Abstractnote             = {Quantitative qPCR is a routinely used method for the accurate quantification of nucleic acids. Yet it may generate erroneous results if the amplification process is obscured by inhibition or generation of aberrant side-products such as primer dimers. Several methods have been established to control for pre-processing performance that rely on the introduction of a co-amplified reference sequence, however there is currently no method to allow for reliable control of the amplification process without directly modifying the sample mix. Herein we present a statistical approach based on multivariate analysis of the amplification response data generated in real-time. The amplification trajectory in its most resolved and dynamic phase is fitted with a suitable model. Two parameters of this model, related to amplification efficiency, are then used for calculation of the Z-score statistics. Each studied sample is compared to a predefined reference set of reactions, typically calibration reactions. A probabilistic decision for each individual Z-score is then used to identify the majority of inhibited reactions in our experiments. We compare this approach to univariate methods using only the sample specific amplification efficiency as reporter of the compatibility. We demonstrate improved identification performance using the multivariate approach compared to the univariate approach. Finally we stress that the performance of the amplification compatibility test as a quality control procedure depends on the quality of the reference set.},

We validated the method on experimental data on multiple targets obtained on the LightCycler platform. The developed method yields results of higher accuracy than the currently used method of serial dilutions for amplification efficiency estimation. The single reaction set-up estimation is sensitive to differences in starting concentrations of the target sequence in samples. Furthermore, it resists the subjective influence of researchers, and the estimation can therefore be fully instrumentalized.},

  Abstract                 = {External RNA controls (ERCs), although important for microarray assay performance assessment, have yet to be fully implemented in the research community. As part of the MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) study, two types of ERCs were implemented and evaluated; one was added to the total RNA in the samples before amplification and labeling; the other was added to the copyRNAs (cRNAs) before hybridization. ERC concentration-response curves were used across multiple commercial microarray platforms to identify problematic assays and potential sources of variation in the analytical process. In addition, the behavior of different ERC types was investigated, resulting in several important observations, such as the sample-dependent attributes of performance and the potential of using these control RNAs in a combinatorial fashion. This multiplatform investigation of the behavior and utility of ERCs provides a basis for articulating specific recommendations for their future use in evaluating assay performance across multiple platforms.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of presented paper was to compare the results of EBV tests performed using real-time PCR (LightCycler EBV Quant Kit-Roche) and “home made” nested PCR in patients with serological confirmed actual or recent EBV infection. In serum samples the presence of IgM and IgG antibody to virus capsid antigen (VCA), IgG antibody to nuclear antigen (EBNA) and early antigen (EA) was tested. Serum samples with the presence anty-VCA IgM (I Group) or with anty EA IgG and without anty-VCA IgM (II Group) were tested by PCR. Real-time PCR results were compared to nested PCR. In both PCR methods 57/60 (95%) concordant results were obtained (10 positive and 47 negative samples). In two serum samples positive result was obtained only by real-time PCR, in one serum sample only by nested PCR. EBV DNA was detected only in serum samples from I Group. Negative EBV DNA detection may be correlated to phase of infection (time after onset of disease) in which the sample was collected, as well as with fact how long EBV is presence in blood. The results indicate that real-time PCR is a reliable tool for diagnosis of primary EBV infection early in the course of disease and may serve as test of confirmation in serologically indeterminate EBV infection (doubtful cases).},

Analysis of a population of cells’ replication state can be achieved by fluorescence labeling of the nuclei of

cells in suspension and then analyzing the fluorescence properties of each cell in the population. Quiescent

and G1 cells will have one copy of DNA and will therefore have 1X fluorescence intensity. Cells in G2/M

phase of the cell cycle will have two copies of DNA and accordingly will have 2X intensity. Since the cells

in S phase are synthesizing DNA they will have fluorescence values between the 1X and 2X populations.

The resulting histrogram consists of three populations: two Gaussian curves (1X and 2X peaks) and the S-

phase population. Adjacent populations overlap each other. Because of this, a modeling program is

required to de-convolute the populations and assign percentage values to each population. Expert and

subjective review of the modeling software’s cell cycle phase percentage assignment is the final stage of

cell cycle analysis prior to reporting the results.

  Abstractnote             = {Here we present Primer3Plus, a new web interface to the popular Primer3 primer design program as an enhanced alternative for the CGI- scripts that come with Primer3. Primer3 consists of a command line program and a web interface. The web interface is one large form showing all of the possible options. This makes the interface powerful, but at the same time confusing for occasional users. Primer3Plus provides an intuitive user interface using present-day web technologies and has been developed in close collaboration with molecular biologists and technicians regularly designing primers. It focuses on the task at hand, and hides detailed settings from the user until these are needed. We also added functionality to automate specific tasks like designing primers for cloning or step-wise sequencing. Settings and designed primer sequences can be stored locally for later use. Primer3Plus supports a range of common sequence formats, such as FASTA. Finally, primers selected by Primer3Plus can be sent to an order form, allowing tight integration into laboratory ordering systems. Moreover, the open architecture of Primer3Plus allows easy expansion or integration of external software packages. The Primer3Plus Perl source code is available under GPL license from SourceForge. Primer3Plus is available at http://www.bioinformatics.nl/primer3plus.},

Biol. 11, 529-533). This motif is present in some but not all mammalian beta tubulin isotypes. We therefore investigated whether this motif is important in ciliary function in mammals. In a preparation of isolated, ATP-reactivated bovine tracheal cilia, we found that monoclonal antibodies directed against the C-terminus of betaI, betaIV and betaV tubulin blocked ciliary beating in a concentration dependent manner. Antibodies against other epitopes of beta tubulin were ineffective, as were antibodies against alpha tubulin. Peptides consisting of the axonemal motif and motif-like sequences of these isotypes blocked ciliary beating. These results suggest that the axonemal motif sequences of betaI, betaIV and betaV tubulin are essential for ciliary function. Peptides consisting of corresponding C-terminal sequences in alpha tubulin isotypes were also ineffective in blocking ciliary beating, which suggests that the C-terminus of alpha tubulin is not directly involved in cilia function in mammals.},

Abstract


This is a note to explain Fisher linear discriminant analysis.


1 Fisher LDA


The most famous example of dimensionality reduction is ”principal components analysis”.

This technique searches for directions in the data that have largest variance and subse-

quently project the data onto it. In this way, we obtain a lower dimensional representation

of the data, that removes some of the ”noisy” directions. There are many difficult issues

with how many directions one needs to choose, but that is beyond the scope of this note.

PCA is an unsupervised technique and as such does not include label information of the

data. For instance, if we imagine 2 cigar like clusters in 2 dimensions, one cigar has y = 1

and the other y = ?1. The cigars are positioned in parallel and very closely together, such

that the variance in the total data-set, ignoring the labels, is in the direction of the cigars.

For classification, this would be a terrible projection, because all labels get evenly mixed

and we destroy the useful information. A much more useful projection is orthogonal to

the cigars, i.e. in the direction of least overall variance, which would perfectly separate the

data-cases (obviously, we would still need to perform classification in this 1-D space).

So the question is, how do we utilize the label information in finding informative projec-

tions? To that purpose Fisher-LDA considers maximizing the following objective:


J(w) = w

TSBw


wTSWw (1)

where SB is the “between classes scatter matrix” and SW is the “within classes scatter

matrix”. Note that due to the fact that scatter matrices are proportional to the covariance

matrices we could have defined J using covariance matrices – the proportionality constant

would have no effect on the solution?. The definitions of the scatter matrices are:


SB = (µc ? x?)(µc ? x?)T (2)

?c ?


SW = (xi ? µc)(xi ? µc)T (3)

c i?c


where x? is the overall mean of the data-cases. Oftentimes you will see that for 2 classes SB

is defined as S?B = (µ1?µ2)(µ1?µ2)T . This is the scatter of class 1 with with respect to},

  Abstractnote             = {. The solution of binary classi cation problems using support vector machines (SVMs) is well developed, but multi-class problems with more than two classes have typically been solved by combining independently produced binary classi ers. We propose a formulation of the SVM that enables a multi-class pattern recognition problem to be solved in a single optimisation. We also propose a similar generalization of linear programming machines. We report experiments using bench-mark datasets in which these two methods achieve a reduction in the number of support vectors and kernel calculations needed. 1. k-Class Pattern Recognition The k-class pattern recognition problem is to construct a decision function given iid (independent and identically distributed) samples (points) of an unknown function, typically with noise: (x1;y1);:::;(x`;y`) (1) where xi; i =1;:::;`is a vector of length d and yi 2f1;:::;kg represents the class of the sample. A natural loss function is the number of mistakes made. 2. Solving k-Class Problems with Binary SVMs For the binary pattern recognition problem (case k = 2), the support vector approach has been well developed 3, 5. The classical approach to solving k-class pattern recognition problems is to consider the problem as a collection of binary classi cation problems. In the one-versus-rest method one constructs k classi ers, one for each class. The n th classi er constructs a hyperplane between class n and the k, 1 other classes. A particular point is assigned to the class for which the distance from the margin, in the positive direction (i.e. in the direction in which class one lies rather than class rest“), is maximal.

Unsupervised clustering methods were used to classify patients into 6 cluster groups (designated A to F) that varied significantly in rates of resistant disease (RD; P < .001), complete response (CR; P = .023), and disease-free survival (DFS; P = .023). Cluster A (n = 24), dominated by NPM1 mutations (78%), normal karyotypes (75%), and genes associated with signaling and apoptosis, had the best DFS (27%) and overall survival (OS; 25% at 5 years). Patients in clusters B (n = 22) and C (n = 31) had the worst OS (5% and 6%, respectively); cluster B was distinguished by the highest rate of RD (77%) and multidrug resistant gene expression (ABCG2, MDR1). Cluster D was characterized by a “proliferative” gene signature with the highest proportion of detectable cytogenetic abnormalities (76%; including 83% of all favorable and 34% of unfavorable karyotypes). Cluster F (n = 33) was dominated by monocytic leukemias (97% of cases), also showing increased NPM1 mutations (61%). These gene expression signatures provide insights into novel groups of AML not predicted by traditional studies that impact prognosis and potential therapy.},

  Abstractnote             = {PLS-regression (PLSR) is the PLS approach in its simplest, and in chemistry and technology, most used form (two-block predictive PLS). PLSR is a method for relating two data matrices, X and Y, by a linear multivariate model, but goes beyond traditional regression in that it models also the structure of X and Y. PLSR derives its usefulness from its ability to analyze data with many, noisy, collinear, and even incomplete variables in both X and Y. PLSR has the desirable property that the precision of the model parameters improves with the increasing number of relevant variables and observations. This article reviews PLSR as it has developed to become a standard tool in chemometrics and used in chemistry and engineering. The underlying model and its assumptions are discussed, and commonly used diagnostics are reviewed together with the interpretation of resulting parameters. Two examples are used as illustrations: First, a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) data set of peptides is used to outline how to develop, interpret and refine a PLSR model. Second, a data set from the manufacturing of recycled paper is analyzed to illustrate time series modelling of process data by means of PLSR and time-lagged X-variables.

The predictive error rate of classifiers can be estimated using methods such as cross-validation. We have investigated issues of interpretation and potential bias in the reporting of error rate estimates. The issues considered here are optimization and selection biases, sampling effects, measures of misclassification rate, baseline error rates, two-level external cross-validation and a novel proposal for detection of bias using the permutation mean. RESULTS: Reporting an optimal estimated error rate incurs an optimization bias. Downward bias of 3-5% was found in an existing study of classification based on gene expression data and may be endemic in similar studies. Using a simulated non-informative dataset and two example datasets from existing studies, we show how bias can be detected through the use of label permutations and avoided using two-level external cross-validation. Some studies avoid optimization bias by using single-level cross-validation and a test set, but error rates can be more accurately estimated via two-level cross-validation. In addition to estimating the simple overall error rate, we recommend reporting class error rates plus where possible the conditional risk incorporating prior class probabilities and a misclassification cost matrix. We also describe baseline error rates derived from three trivial classifiers which ignore the predictors.

  Abstractnote             = {In microarray technology, a number of critical steps are required to convert the raw measurements into the data relied upon by biologists and clinicians. These data manipulations, referred to as preprocessing, influence the quality of the ultimate measurements and studies that rely upon them. Standard operating procedure for microarray researchers is to use preprocessed data as the starting point for the statistical analyses that produce reported results. This has prevented many researchers from carefully considering their choice of preprocessing methodology. Furthermore, the fact that the preprocessing step affects the stochastic properties of the final statistical summaries is often ignored. In this paper we propose a statistical framework that permits the integration of preprocessing into the standard statistical analysis flow of microarray data. This general framework is relevant in many microarray platforms and motivates targeted analysis methods for specific applications. We demonstrate its usefulness by applying the idea in three different applications of the technology.},

  Abstractnote             = {High density oligonucleotide expression arrays are widely used in many areas of biomedical research. Affymetrix GeneChip arrays are the most popular. In the Affymetrix system, a fair amount of further pre-processing and data reduction occurs following the image processing step. Statistical procedures developed by academic groups have been successful at improving the default algorithms provided by the Affymetrix system. In this paper we present a solution to one of the pre-processing steps, background adjustment, based on a formal statistical framework. Our solution greatly improves the performance of the technology in various practical applications. Affymetrix GeneChip arrays use short oligonucleotides to probe for genes in an RNA sample. Typically each gene will be represented by 11-20 pairs of oligonucleotide probes. The first component of these pairs is referred to as a perfect match probe and is designed to hybridize only with transcripts from the intended gene (specific hybridization). However, hybridization by other sequences (non-specific hybridization) is unavoidable. Furthermore, hybridization strengths are measured by a scanner that introduces optical noise. Therefore, the observed intensities need to be adjusted to give accurate measurements of specific hybridization. One approach to adjusting is to pair each perfect match probe with a mismatch probe that is designed with the intention of measuring non-specific hybridization. The default adjustment, provided as part of the Affymetrix system, is based on the difference between perfect match and mismatch probe intensities. We have found that this approach can be improved via the use of estimators derived from a statistical model that use probe sequence information. The model is based on simple hybridization theory from molecular biology and experiments specifically designed to help develop it. A final step in the pre-processing of these arrays is to combine the 11-20 probe pair intensities, after background adjustment and normalization, for a given gene to define a measure of expression that represents the amount of the corresponding mRNA species. In this paper we illustrate the practical consequences of not adjusting appropriately for the presence of nonspecific hybridization and provide a solution based on our background adjustment procedure. Software that computes our adjustment is available as part of the Bioconductor project},

For high-dimensional microarray data classification, due to the small number of samples and large number of features, classical LDA has sub-optimal performance corresponding to the singularity and instability of the within-group covariance matrix. Two modified LDA approaches (MLDA and NLDA) were applied for microarray classification and their performance criteria were compared with other popular classification algorithms across a range of feature set sizes (number of genes) using both simulated and real datasets. The results showed that the overall performance of the two modified LDA approaches was as competitive as support vector machines and other regularized LDA approaches and better than diagonal linear discriminant analysis, k -nearest neighbor, and classical LDA. It was concluded that the modified LDA approaches can be used as an effective classification tool in limited sample size and high-dimensional microarray classification problems.},

In this paper, we follow an opposite rationale: we try to identify common molecular features shared by phenotypically distinct types of cancer using a meta-analysis of several microarray studies. We present a novel algorithm to uncover that two lists of differentially expressed genes are similar, even if these similarities are not apparent to the eye. The method is based on the ordering in the lists. RESULTS: In a meta-analysis of five clinical microarray studies we were able to detect significant similarities in five of the ten possible comparisons of ordered gene lists. We included studies, where not a single gene can be significantly associated to outcome. The detection of significant similarities of gene lists from different microarray studies is a novel and promising approach. It has the potential to improve upon specialized cancer studies by exploring the power of several studies in one single analysis. Our method is complementary to previous methods in that it does not rely on strong effects of differential gene expression in a single study but on consistent ones across multiple studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is based on the concept of tailoring the intensity of therapy to a patient?s risk of relapse. To determine whether gene expression profiling could enhance risk assignment, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze the pattern of genes expressed in leukemic blasts from 360 pediatric ALL patients. Distinct expression profiles identified each of the prognostically important leukemia subtypes, including T-ALL, E2A-PBX1, BCR-ABL, TEL-AML1, MLL rearrangement, and hyperdiploid >50 chromosomes. In addition, another ALL subgroup was identified based on its unique expression profile. Examination of the genes comprising the expression signatures provided important insights into the biology of these leukemia subgroups. Further, within some genetic subgroups, expression profiles identified those patients that would eventually fail therapy. Thus, the single platform of expression profiling should enhance the accurate risk stratification of pediatric ALL patients.},

  Abstractnote             = {Background: Even though real-time PCR has been broadly applied in biomedical sciences, data processing procedures for the analysis of quantitative real-time PCR are still lacking; specifically in the realm of appropriate statistical treatment. Confidence interval and statistical significance considerations are not explicit in many of the current data analysis approaches. Based on the standard curve method and other useful data analysis methods, we present and compare four statistical approaches and models for the analysis of real-time PCR data. Results: In the first approach, a multiple regression analysis model was developed to derive Ct from estimation of interaction of gene and treatment effects. In the second approach, an ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) model was proposed, and the Ct can be derived from analysis of effects of variables. The other two models involve calculation Ct followed by a two group t-test and non-parametric analogous Wilcoxon test. SAS programs were developed for all four models and data output for analysis of a sample set are presented. In addition, a data quality control model was developed and implemented using SAS. Conclusion: Practical statistical solutions with SAS programs were developed for real-time PCR data and a sample dataset was analyzed with the SAS programs. The analysis using the various models and programs yielded similar results. Data quality control and analysis procedures presented here provide statistical elements for the estimation of the relative expression of genes using real-time PCR.},

  Abstractnote             = {The statistical treatment for hypothesis testing using real-time PCR data is a challenge for quantification of gene expression. One has to consider two key factors in precise statistical analysis of real-time PCR data: a well-defined statistical model and the integration of amplification efficiency (AE) into the model. Previous publications in real-time PCR data analysis often fall short in integrating the AE into the model. Novel, user-friendly, and universal AE-integrated statistical methods were developed for real-time PCR data analysis with four goals. First, we addressed the definition of AE, introduced the concept of efficiency-adjusted Delta Delta Ct, and developed a general mathematical method for its calculation. Second, we developed several linear combination approaches for the estimation of efficiency adjusted Delta Delta Ct and statistical significance for hypothesis testing based on different mathematical formulae and experimental designs. Statistical methods were also adopted to estimate the AE and its equivalence among the samples. A weighted Delta Delta Ct method was introduced to analyze the data with multiple internal controls. Third, we implemented the linear models with SAS programs and analyzed a set of data for each model. In order to allow other researchers to use and compare different approaches, SAS programs are included in the Supporting Information. Fourth, the results from analysis of different statistical models were compared and discussed. Our results underline the differences between the efficiency adjusted Delta Delta Ct methods and previously published methods, thereby better identifying and controlling the source of errors introduced by real-time PCR data analysis.},

Here, we describe a model of binding interactions on microarrays that reveals how probe signals depend on probe sequences and why certain probes are ineffective. The model indicates that the amount of nonspecific binding can be estimated from a simple rule. Using this model, we have developed an improved measure of gene expression for use in data analysis.},

  Abstractnote             = {Motivation: According to current consistency metrics such as percentage of overlapping genes (POG), lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) detected from different microarray studies for a complex disease are often highly inconsistent. This irreproducibility problem also exists in other high-throughput post-genomic areas such as proteomics and metabolism. A complex disease is often characterized with many coordinated molecular changes, which should be considered when evaluating the reproducibility of discovery lists from different studies. Results: We proposed metrics percentage of overlapping genes-related (POGR) and normalized POGR (nPOGR) to evaluate the consistency between two DEG lists for a complex disease, considering correlated molecular changes rather than only counting gene overlaps between the lists. Based on microarray datasets of three diseases, we showed that though the POG scores for DEG lists from different studies for each disease are extremely low, the POGR and nPOGR scores can be rather high, suggesting that the apparently inconsistent DEG lists may be highly reproducible in the sense that they are actually significantly correlated. Observing different discovery results for a disease by the POGR and nPOGR scores will obviously reduce the uncertainty of the microarray studies. The proposed metrics could also be applicable in many other high-throughput post-genomic areas.

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: An important goal in analyzing microarray data is to determine which genes are differentially expressed across two kinds of tissue samples or samples obtained under two experimental conditions. Various parametric tests, such as the two-sample t-test, have been used, but their possibly too strong parametric assumptions or large sample justifications may not hold in practice. As alternatives, a class of three nonparametric statistical methods, including the empirical Bayes method of Efron et al. (2001), the significance analysis of microarray (SAM) method of Tusher et al. (2001) and the mixture model method (MMM) of Pan et al. (2001), have been proposed. All the three methods depend on constructing a test statistic and a so-called null statistic such that the null statistic?s distribution can be used to approximate the null distribution of the test statistic. However, relatively little effort has been directed toward assessment of the performance or the underlying assumptions of the methods in constructing such test and null statistics. RESULTS: We point out a problem of a current method to construct the test and null statistics, which may lead to largely inflated Type I errors (i.e. false positives). We also propose two modifications that overcome the problem. In the context of MMM, the improved performance of the modified methods is demonstrated using simulated data. In addition, our numerical results also provide evidence to support the utility and effectiveness of MMM.},

  Abstractnote             = {Background: Housekeeping (HK) genes are ubiquitously expressed in all tissue/cell types and constitute a basal transcriptome for the maintenance of basic cellular functions. Partitioning transcriptomes into HK and tissue-specific (TS) genes relatively is fundamental for studying gene expression and cellular differentiation. Although many studies have aimed at large-scale and thorough categorization of human HK genes, a meaningful consensus has yet to be reached. Results: We collected two latest gene expression datasets (both EST and microarray data) from public databases and analyzed the gene expression profiles in 18 human tissues that have been well-documented by both two data types. Benchmarked by a manually-curated HK gene collection (HK408), we demonstrated that present data from EST sampling was far from saturated, and the inadequacy has limited the gene detectability and our understanding of TS expressions. Due to a likely over-stringent threshold, microarray data showed higher false negative rate compared with EST data, leading to a significant underestimation of HK genes. Based on EST data, we found that 40.0% of the currently annotated human genes were universally expressed in at least 16 of 18 tissues, as compared to only 5.1% specifically expressed in a single tissue. Our current EST-based estimate on human HK genes ranged from 3,140 to 6,909 in number, a ten-fold increase in comparison with previous microarray-based estimates. Conclusion: We concluded that a significant fraction of human genes, at least in the currently annotated data depositories, was broadly expressed. Our understanding of tissue-specific expression was still preliminary and required much more large-scale and high-quality transcriptomic data in future studies. The new HK gene list categorized in this study will be useful for genome-wide analyses on structural and functional features of HK genes.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: The presence of similar histologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian and endometrial cancers has long been noted, although the relevance of this finding to pathogenesis and clinical management is unclear. Despite similar clinical characteristics, histologic subtypes of cancers of the ovary and endometrium are treated according to organ of origin. This study compares the gene expression profiles of analogous histologic subtypes of cancers of the ovary and endometrium using the same genomic platform to determine the similarities and differences between these tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiles of 75 cancers (endometrioid, serous, and clear cell) of the ovary and endometrium, five renal clear cell cancers, and seven normal epithelial brushings were determined using a 11,000-element cDNA array. All images were analyzed using BRB ArrayTools. Validation was done using real-time PCR on select genes and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Comparison across endometrial and ovarian cancers and serous and endometrioid tumors showed expression patterns reflecting their organ of origin. Clear cell tumors, however, showed remarkably similar expression patterns regardless of their origin, even when compared with renal clear cell samples. A set of 43 genes was common to comparisons of each of the three histologic subtypes of ovarian cancer with normal ovarian surface epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: The comparison of the gene expression profiles of endometrioid and serous subtypes of ovarian and endometrial cancer are largely unique to the combination of a particular subtype in a specific organ. In contrast, clear cell cancers show a remarkable similarity in gene expression profiles across organs (including kidney) and could not be statistically distinguished.},
